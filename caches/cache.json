[ ] **Robot Visible at \"Home\":** Look at the map display. Confirm that the robot's icon (often a red oval) is currently positioned accurately at the location of the \"Home\" goal.\n\n**Phase 2: Choose Your Interactive Docking Method**\n\nThe manual describes two main ways to initiate docking interactively from the map:\n\n**Method 1: Using the Direct 'Dock' Command (Recommended First Try)**\n\nThis is generally the most straightforward method as it directly commands the docking action.\n\n*   **Step 1:** Confirm all prerequisites in Phase 1 are met.\n*   **Step 2:** With \"Show Robot\" ON, locate the **robot-specific toolbar**. This toolbar becomes available when \"Show Robot\" is active.\n*   **Step 3:** Click the **Dock** button found on this toolbar (Page 70, Page 52).\n*   **Step 4 (Alternative Menu Option):** Instead of the toolbar button, you can go to the main menu bar at the top and select **Robot > Dock** (Page 52).\n*   **Action:** Selecting either the button or the menu item commands the AIV to begin its full docking sequence from its current location (\"Home\"). Proceed to Phase 3.\n\n**Method 2: Sending the Robot to the 'Dock Object' (Alternative)**\n\nThis method involves telling the robot to first navigate to the virtual approach point you defined near the dock.\n\n*   **Step 1:** Confirm all prerequisites in Phase 1 are met.\n*   **Step 2:** Activate the \"Send Robot\" mode:\n    *   Click the **Send Robot** icon, usually found on the main Map toolbar (Page 76). Your mouse cursor should change shape.\n    *   *Alternatively*, press and hold the `Ctrl` key on your keyboard (Page 76).\n*   **Step 3:** **Very Important:** Locate the specific **Dock object** symbol on your map. This is *not* a symbol for the physical charging station itself, but the virtual point you should have created during map editing, typically placed 1 to 1.5 meters *in front* of the physical dock and pointing towards it (Page 116).\n*   **Step 4:** While the \"Send Robot\" cursor is active (or while holding `Ctrl`), click your left mouse button precisely on this **Dock object** symbol.\n*   **Action:** The AIV will navigate from \"Home\" towards this Dock object. Once it reaches that point, its configured automatic docking behavior (potentially related to the `AutoDock` parameter mentioned on Page 52) should initiate the final maneuver onto the charger. Proceed to Phase 3.\n\n**Phase 3: Observe the Action**\n\n*   **On the Map:** Look at the MobilePlanner map. You should see a path being calculated and displayed from the \"Home\" goal towards the docking station. The robot's icon will begin moving along this path.\n*   **Physically:** Watch your actual AIV. It should start driving autonomously towards the docking station and perform the necessary maneuvers to connect for charging.\n\nYou have now successfully commanded your AIV to dock from the \"Home\" goal using the interactive features of the MobilePlanner map!", "ddeb817c7de2bbe0be348949f2daf039033fd4120df8dc6c56b0ec14ff86a812": "1. **Reflect on Previous Attempt**:\n   - My previous attempt was more technical and not simplified for a 10-year-old.

Methods often involve a two-step process: first learning from historical data, and then estimating the delayed impact using importance sampling to inform future decisions.\n\n**5. Distribution Shift:** This addresses fairness when data distributions change over time.  Methods focus on adapting classifiers to changing environments or making them robust to distribution shifts, without direct model-environment interaction.\n\n\nThe document emphasizes that achieving long-term fairness requires moving beyond static, one-shot approaches and incorporating dynamic modeling of the environment and feedback loops.
