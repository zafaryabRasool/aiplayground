What is the difference between Alzheimer's disease and dementia?\\nShare this infographic and help spread the word about understanding different types of dementia. \\nAlzheimer's disease is a type of dementia. Dementia is a loss of thinking, remembering, and reasoning skills that interferes with a person's daily life and activities. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia among older people. Other types of dementia include frontotemporal disorders, Lewy body dementia, and vascular dementia.\\nLearn more about Alzheimer's disease and dementia.\\n2. What are the early signs of Alzheimer's disease?\\nMemory problems are typically one of the first signs of Alzheimer's disease, though different people may have different initial symptoms. A decline in other aspects of thinking, such as finding the right words, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning or judgment, may also signal the very early stages of Alzheimer's disease.\\nMild cognitive impairment, or MCI, is a condition that can also be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease — but not everyone with MCI will develop Alzheimer's. In addition to memory problems, movement difficulties and problems with the sense of smell have been linked to MCI. If you have MCI, it’s important to see a doctor or specialist regularly to monitor any changes in memory or thinking .\\nLearn more about the signs of Alzheimer's disease.\\n3. What are the stages of Alzheimer's disease?\\nAlzheimer's disease progresses in several stages: preclinical, early (also called mild), middle (moderate), and late (severe). During the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease, people seem to be symptom-free, but toxic changes are taking place in the brain. A person in the early stage of Alzheimer's may exhibit the signs listed above.\\nAs Alzheimer's disease progresses to the middle stage, memory loss and confusion grow worse, and people may have problems recognizing family and friends. As Alzheimer's disease becomes more severe, people lose the ability to communicate. They may sleep more, lose weight, and have trouble swallowing. Eventually, they need total care.\\nLearn more about the stages of Alzheimer's disease.\\n4. What are the causes of Alzheimer's disease?\\nScientists do not yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer's disease in most people. In early-onset Alzheimer's, which occurs between a person's 30s and mid-60s, there may be a genetic component. Late-onset Alzheimer's, which usually develops in a person's mid-60s, arises from a complex series of age-related brain changes that occur over decades. The causes probably include a mix of these changes, along with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. These factors affect each person differently.\\nDown syndrome, a genetic condition, increases a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Estimates suggest that 50% or more of people with Down syndrome will develop Alzheimer’s disease and may begin to show symptoms in their 40s.\\nLearn more about the factors that influence Alzheimer's disease.\\n5. Is Alzheimer's disease hereditary?\\nRead and share this infographic to learn more about how Alzheimer's disease runs in families.\\nJust because a family member has Alzheimer's disease does not mean that you will get it, too. Most cases of Alzheimer's are late-onset. This form of the disease occurs in a person's mid-60s and is not linked to a specific change in genes. However, genetic factors appear to increase a person's risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's.\\nEarly-onset Alzheimer's disease, which is rare, can be caused by genetic variants, or changes in certain genes. If one of the genetic variants is passed down, the child will usually — but not always — have the disease. For other cases of early-onset Alzheimer's, research shows other genetic components are involved.\\nLearn more about assessing risk for Alzheimer's disease.\\n6. Is there a cure for Alzheimer's disease?\\nCurrently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. Some sources claim that products such as coconut oil or dietary supplements can cure or delay Alzheimer's. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims.\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several drugs to treat people with Alzheimer's disease, and certain medicines and interventions may help control behavioral symptoms.\\nLearn more about how Alzheimer's disease is treated.\\nScientists are developing and testing possible new treatments for Alzheimer's. Learn more about taking part in clinical trials that help scientists learn about the brain in healthy aging and what happens in Alzheimer's and other dementias. Results of these trials are used to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention methods.\\n7. Is there a way to prevent Alzheimer's disease?\\nCurrently, there is no definitive evidence about what can prevent Alzheimer's disease or age-related cognitive decline. What we do know is that a healthy lifestyle — one that includes a healthy diet, physical activity, appropriate weight, and control of high blood pressure — can lower the risk of certain chronic diseases and boost overall health and well-being. Scientists are very interested in the possibility that a healthy lifestyle might delay, slow down, or even prevent Alzheimer's. They are also studying the role of social activity and intellectual stimulation in Alzheimer's disease risk.\\nLearn more about cognitive health and older adults and reducing your risk for Alzheimer's disease.\\n8. Where can I find financial help for people with Alzheimer's disease or their caregivers?\\nThere are several possible sources of financial help, depending on your situation. Looking into programs offered by the government is a great place to start. Several federal and state programs provide help with health care-related costs. Read Paying for Care for information on government programs and other payment sources.\\nThe following organizations also offer assistance with finding financial help:\\nEldercare Locator\\n800-677-1116\\nNational Council on Aging(link is external)\\n571-527-3900\\nFamily Caregiver Alliance(link is external)\\n800-445-8106\\nFor more information about Alzheimer's\\nNIA Alzheimer’s and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center\\n800-438-4380\\nadear@nia.nih.gov(link sends email)\\nwww.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers\\nThe NIA ADEAR Center offers information and free print publications about Alzheimer’s and related dementias for families, caregivers, and health professionals.

It’s important to distinguish the facts from the myths about Alzheimer’s, especially when it comes to finding information online. Read on to learn about common myths surrounding this disease.\\nMyth 1: Alzheimer’s disease and dementia are the same thing.\\nShare this infographic and help spread the word about understanding different types of dementia.\\nPeople often use the terms Alzheimer’s and dementia interchangeably, but there is a difference. Dementia refers generally to conditions that lead to impaired memory, thinking, reasoning, and behavior, and Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia. The terms are likely confused because Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia and the most well-known. Other types of dementia include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia.\\nLearn more about Alzheimer’s and related dementias.\\nMyth 2: I will develop Alzheimer’s disease if my parent has it.\\nIf a parent or close relative has Alzheimer’s, you may be worried about developing it as you get older. A person’s chance of developing Alzheimer’s is higher if they have certain genetic variants that can be passed down from a parent. However, in most cases, just because a biological parent has Alzheimer’s does not mean their children will develop it.\\nRead and share this infographic and help spread the word about Alzheimer's genetics. \\nAlzheimer’s is complex, and scientists don’t yet fully understand what causes it in most people. Research suggests that in most individuals, a host of factors beyond genetics play a role in the development and course of the disease. Environmental and lifestyle factors such as exercise, diet, exposure to pollutants, and smoking may also affect a person’s risk for Alzheimer’s. Although we don’t yet know how to prevent the disease, it’s important to practice healthy behaviors throughout your lifetime, such as exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet.\\nLearn more about Alzheimer’s genetics.\\nMyth 3: Only people in their 70s and older develop Alzheimer’s disease.\\nWhile the greatest known risk factor for Alzheimer’s is age, this does not mean that only older adults develop it. For most people with Alzheimer’s, it’s true that symptoms first appear in their mid-60s or beyond. However, some people experience symptoms earlier, even as young as in their 30s. When a person develops Alzheimer’s between their 30s and mid-60s, it’s called early-onset Alzheimer’s. Early-onset Alzheimer’s is rare — representing less than 10% of people with the disease. Developing Alzheimer’s earlier in life can present specific challenges. People diagnosed at younger ages are more likely to be raising children or working outside the home, or both.\\nMany people living with Down syndrome, a genetic condition, will also develop Alzheimer’s at an earlier age and may begin to show symptoms in their 40s.\\nLearn more about the causes of Alzheimer’s.\\nMyth 4: Alzheimer’s disease symptoms are normal as we get older.\\nMany people become more forgetful as they age, and some forgetfulness, such as losing things from time to time, is normal. However, common signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s, such as making poor judgments and decisions a lot of the time, having problems recognizing friends and family, or losing track of the date or time of year are not a normal part of aging.\\nIf you are worried about your memory or other possible Alzheimer’s symptoms, talk with your doctor. The doctor may ask questions about your health history, perform assessments of your thinking and memory, and conduct medical tests to determine your diagnosis.\\nLearn more about the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s.\\nMyth 5: There are no treatments available for people with Alzheimer’s disease.\\nIn recent years, significant progress has been made toward developing better treatments for people living with Alzheimer’s. Several medications are now available to treat symptoms and slow the disease in some people. Coping strategies are also available to help manage behavioral symptoms.\\nWhile there is currently no cure for Alzheimer’s, research has never been more promising thanks to scientific advances. In total, NIA is funding hundreds of clinical trials including both drug and nondrug interventions. These include testing treatments that target the underlying causes of the disease as well as behavior and lifestyle factors.\\nLearn more about how Alzheimer’s is treated, including FDA-approved medications, and where to find Alzheimer’s clinical trials.\\nMyth 6: If I’m frequently forgetting things, it must be Alzheimer’s disease.\\nEven though memory problems are typically one of the first signs of Alzheimer’s, not all memory problems mean a person has the disease. Some forgetfulness is normal as we age.\\nTalk with your doctor to determine whether the memory changes you’re noticing are normal or may be a sign of something more serious. In some cases, depression or medication side effects can cause memory and other thinking problems. It may be possible to reverse some memory problems depending on the cause.\\nLearn more about what’s normal memory loss and what’s not.\\nMyth 7: You can buy supplements online to prevent or cure Alzheimer’s disease.\\nThere are many websites and advertisements that promise certain supplements can effectively prevent, delay, treat, or cure diseases such as Alzheimer’s. In some cases, the information may seem reliable, offering advice on healthy aging and Alzheimer's to gain trust and promote their products. However, there is no scientific evidence backing these claims, and currently, no supplement has been proven to delay, prevent, treat, or cure Alzheimer’s.\\nLearn more about the safety and side effects of specific supplements. Talk with your doctor before taking any supplements or trying any other new treatments.\\nFind tips to help determine whether an online health information article is reliable.\\nMyth 8: You can prevent Alzheimer’s disease.\\nThere is no proven way to prevent Alzheimer’s. However, there are steps you can take to help reduce your risk for this disease. A risk factor is something that may increase a person’s chance of developing a disease. Some risk factors can be controlled, while others, such as the genes you inherit, cannot.\\nIn general, leading a healthy lifestyle may help reduce risk factors that have been associated with Alzheimer’s and other age-related health problems. These include:\\nControlling high blood pressure\\nMaintaining a healthy weight\\nStaying mentally and physically active\\nPreventing head injury\\nSleeping seven to nine hours each night\\nWearing hearing restorative devices (such as hearing aids and cochlear implants), if needed\\nLearn more about what we know about preventing Alzheimer’s — including the benefits of high blood pressure control — and reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s.\\nMyth 9: Doctors cannot definitively diagnose someone with Alzheimer’s disease until after death.\\nBefore researchers developed biomarker tests in the early 2000s, the only sure way to know whether a person had Alzheimer’s was through autopsy, a procedure that is performed after death. Now, lab and imaging tests are available to help a doctor or researcher see the biological signs of the disease in a living person. For example, it is now possible for doctors to order a blood test to measure levels of beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates abnormally in people with Alzheimer’s. Several other blood tests are in development. However, the availability of these tests is still limited. NIA-funded scientists continue to study options for faster, less expensive, and less invasive ways to diagnose Alzheimer’s.\\nLearn more about biomarkers and Alzheimer’s detection and research.\\nMyth 10: An at-home genetic test can tell me if I have (or will have) Alzheimer’s disease.\\nYou may have heard about at-home genetic tests. These tests extract DNA from a person’s saliva and provide reports of the genetic data. It’s important to note that no genetic test can definitively diagnose Alzheimer’s. Genetic tests can identify certain rare genetic variants that cause early-onset Alzheimer’s, as well as genetic variants that increase a person’s risk for the disease. FDA has approved one of these tests for at-home use. This test shows if a person carries a form of the APOE gene, APOE ε4. People with this variant are at an increased risk for Alzheimer’s, but it does not mean that they will definitely develop the disease.\\nTalk with your doctor about these types of genetic tests. You also may want to schedule an appointment with a genetic counselor to help you consider whether a test is right for you and to understand the results.\\nLearn more about Alzheimer’s genetics.\\nMyth 11: I’m not a scientist so I can’t do anything to help fight Alzheimer’s disease.\\nRead and share this infographic about the types of volunteers needed for dementia research.\\nEven if you are not a scientist, there are many ways you can help advance Alzheimer’s research! Volunteers participating in clinical trials and studies have led to meaningful advancements in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer’s. By joining a trial or study, you become a partner in helping researchers advance their knowledge toward effective diagnostics, treatments, and preventions. All types of volunteers are needed, including people living with dementia, caregivers, and healthy participants.\\nAs a family member or friend of a person living with Alzheimer’s, you can also help by offering support, such as learning tips for communication or finding suitable activities. You can also offer help by supporting caregivers of people with Alzheimer’s or a related dementia.\\nLearn more about participating in Alzheimer’s research and where to find a clinical trial.\\nMyth 12: Aluminum causes Alzheimer’s disease.\\nAluminum is a metal commonly found in things such as pots, pans, and even the Earth's soil. Scientists are still trying to understand if there is a link between aluminum and Alzheimer's. For example, autopsy studies have shown higher levels of aluminum in the brains of people with Alzheimer's than those without Alzheimer's, but it’s unclear what role aluminum may play. Researchers continue to explore how environmental factors, such as metals, air pollution, and other chemicals, may affect a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s.\\nYou may also be interested in\\nReading more about Alzheimer's and related dementias\\nWatching a video on dementia(link is external)\\nLearning about participating in Alzheimer's research\\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

In most people with Alzheimer’s, symptoms first appear later in life. Estimates vary, but experts suggest that more than 6 million Americans, most of them age 65 or older, may have Alzheimer’s.\\nAlzheimer’s is currently ranked as the seventh leading cause of death in the United States and is the most common cause of dementia among older adults.\\nDementia is the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — and behavioral abilities to such an extent that it interferes with a person’s daily life and activities. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person’s functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for help with basic activities of daily living.\\nShare this infographic and help spread the word about understanding different types of dementia.\\nThe causes of dementia can vary depending on the types of brain changes that may be taking place. Other forms of dementia include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, and vascular dementia. It is common for people to have mixed dementia — a combination of two or more types of dementia. For example, some people have both Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia.\\nAlzheimer’s disease is named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer. In 1906, Dr. Alzheimer noticed changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness. Her symptoms included memory loss, language problems, and unpredictable behavior. After she died, he examined her brain and found many abnormal clumps (now called amyloid plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers (now called neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles).\\nThese plaques and tangles in the brain are still considered some of the main features of Alzheimer’s. Another feature is the loss of connections between neurons in the brain. Neurons transmit messages between different parts of the brain, and from the brain to muscles and organs in the body.\\nParticipating in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials\\nEverybody — those with Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment as well as healthy volunteers with or without a family history of Alzheimer’s — may be able to take part in clinical trials and studies. Participants in Alzheimer’s clinical research can help scientists learn how the brain changes in healthy aging and in Alzheimer’s.\\nMany volunteers are needed to participate in the hundreds of active clinical trials and studies that are testing ways to better understand, diagnose, treat, and prevent Alzheimer’s. Researchers need participants of different ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities to ensure that results are meaningful for many people. To learn more about clinical trials, watch this video from the NIH National Library of Medicine.\\nNIA leads the federal government’s research efforts on Alzheimer’s. NIA-funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers throughout the United States conduct a wide range of research, including trials and studies of the causes, diagnosis, and management of the disease. NIA also sponsors the Alzheimer’s Clinical Trials Consortium, which is designed to accelerate and expand research and therapies in Alzheimer’s and related dementias.\\nTo learn more about Alzheimer’s clinical trials and studies:\\nTalk to your health care provider about local studies that may be right for you.\\nSearch the Alzheimers.gov Clinical Trials Finder for options near you or sign up for email alerts about new trials and studies.\\nSign up for a registry or matching service to be invited to participate in trials and studies.\\nContact an Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center or a memory or neurology clinic in your community.\\nLearn more about participating in clinical trials. Watch videos of participants in Alzheimer’s clinical trials talking about their experiences.\\nHow does Alzheimer's disease affect the brain?\\nScientists continue to unravel the complex brain changes involved in Alzheimer’s. Changes in the brain may begin a decade or more before symptoms appear. During this very early stage of Alzheimer’s, toxic changes are taking place in the brain, including abnormal buildups of proteins that form amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Previously healthy neurons stop functioning, lose connections with other neurons, and die. Many other complex brain changes are thought to play a role in Alzheimer’s as well.\\nThe damage initially appears to take place in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, which are parts of the brain that are essential in forming memories. As more neurons die, additional parts of the brain are affected and begin to shrink. By the final stage of Alzheimer’s, damage is widespread and brain tissue has shrunk significantly.\\nSigns and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease\\nMemory problems are typically one of the first signs of cognitive impairment related to Alzheimer’s. Some people with memory problems have a condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). With MCI, people have more memory problems than normal for their age, but their symptoms do not interfere with their everyday lives. Movement difficulties and problems with the sense of smell have also been linked to MCI. Older people with MCI are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer’s, but not all of them do so. Some may even revert to normal cognition.\\nThe first symptoms of Alzheimer’s vary from person to person. For many, decline in nonmemory aspects of cognition, such as word finding, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning or judgment may signal the very early stages of the disease. Researchers are studying biomarkers (biological signs of disease found in brain images, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood) to detect early changes in the brains of people with MCI and in cognitively normal people who may be at greater risk for Alzheimer’s. More research is needed before these techniques can be used broadly and routinely to diagnose Alzheimer’s in a health care provider’s office.\\nStages of Alzheimer's disease\\nMild Alzheimer’s disease\\nAs Alzheimer’s worsens, people experience greater memory loss and other cognitive difficulties. Problems can include wandering and getting lost, trouble handling money and paying bills, repeating questions, taking longer to complete normal daily tasks, and personality and behavior changes. People are often diagnosed in this stage.\\nModerate Alzheimer’s disease\\nIn this stage, damage occurs in areas of the brain that control language, reasoning, conscious thought, and sensory processing, such as the ability to correctly detect sounds and smells. Memory loss and confusion grow worse, and people begin to have problems recognizing family and friends. They may be unable to learn new things, carry out multistep tasks such as getting dressed, or cope with new situations. In addition, people at this stage may have hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia and may behave impulsively.\\nSevere Alzheimer’s disease\\nUltimately, plaques and tangles spread throughout the brain, and brain tissue shrinks significantly. People with severe Alzheimer’s cannot communicate and are completely dependent on others for their care. Near the end of life, the person may be in bed most or all of the time as the body shuts down.\\nWhat causes Alzheimer’s disease?\\nIn recent years, scientists have made tremendous progress in better understanding Alzheimer’s and the momentum continues to grow. Still, scientists don’t yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer’s disease in most people. The causes probably include a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. The importance of any one of these factors in increasing or decreasing the risk of developing Alzheimer’s may differ from person to person.\\nThe basics of Alzheimer’s disease\\nScientists are conducting studies to learn more about plaques, tangles, and other biological features of Alzheimer’s. Advances in brain imaging techniques enable researchers to see the development and spread of abnormal amyloid and tau proteins in the living brain, as well as changes in brain structure and function. Scientists are also exploring the very earliest steps in the disease process by studying changes in the brain and body fluids that can be detected years before Alzheimer’s symptoms appear. Findings from these studies will help improve our understanding of the causes of Alzheimer’s and make diagnosis easier.\\nOne of the great mysteries of Alzheimer’s is why it largely affects older adults. Research on normal brain aging is exploring this question. For example, scientists are learning how age-related changes in the brain may harm neurons and affect other types of brain cells to contribute to Alzheimer’s damage. These age-related changes include atrophy (shrinking) of certain parts of the brain, inflammation, blood vessel damage, production of unstable molecules called free radicals, and mitochondrial dysfunction (a breakdown of energy production within a cell).\\nAlzheimer's disease genetics\\nIn most cases, Alzheimer’s does not have a single genetic cause. Instead, it is likely influenced by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. Changes in genes, called genetic variations, may increase or decrease a person’s risk of developing the disease.\\nScientists currently know of more than 80 genetic regions associated with Alzheimer’s. Of the genetic variants associated with Alzheimer’s so far, only three are known to cause the disease. Although it happens rarely, when someone inherits an altered version of one of these genes — APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 — they will likely develop Alzheimer’s before age 65 and sometimes much earlier.\\nPeople with Down syndrome also have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s earlier in life. Down syndrome results from having an extra chromosome 21, which carries the APP gene that produces the amyloid precursor protein. Too much of this protein leads to build-up of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Estimates suggest that 50% or more of people living with Down syndrome will develop Alzheimer’s with symptoms appearing in their 50s and 60s.\\nAnother genetic variation, in the APOE gene, which has several forms, is known to influence the risk of Alzheimer’s. Specifically, APOE ε4 increases a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s and is also associated with developing Alzheimer’s earlier in life for certain populations. APOE ε2 may provide some protection against Alzheimer’s.\\nChanges in different genes, along with other biomedical, lifestyle, and environmental factors, play a role in potentially developing Alzheimer’s. Still, it is never known for certain if any individual will or will not develop the disease.\\nFor more about Alzheimer’s genetics research, see NIA’s Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Fact Sheet.\\nHealth, environmental, and lifestyle factors\\nResearch suggests that a host of factors beyond genetics may play a role in the development and course of Alzheimer’s. There is a great deal of interest, for example, in the relationship between cognitive decline and vascular conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure, as well as metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. Ongoing research will help us understand whether and how reducing risk factors for these conditions may also reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s.\\nA nutritious diet, physical activity, social engagement, and mentally stimulating pursuits have all been associated with helping people stay healthy as they age. These factors might also help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s. Researchers are testing some of these possibilities in clinical trials.\\nHow is Alzheimer’s disease diagnosed?\\nDoctors use several methods and tools to help determine whether a person who is having memory problems has Alzheimer’s.\\nTo diagnose Alzheimer’s, doctors may:\\nAsk the person and a family member or friend questions about overall health, use of prescription and over-the-counter medicines, diet, past medical problems, ability to carry out daily activities, and changes in behavior and personality.\\nConduct tests of memory, problem solving, attention, counting, and language.\\nOrder blood, urine, and other standard medical tests to help identify other possible causes of the problem.\\nAdminister tests to determine if depression or another mental health condition is causing or contributing to a person’s symptoms.\\nCollect cerebrospinal fluid via a spinal tap or order blood tests to measure the levels of proteins associated with Alzheimer’s and related dementias.\\nPerform brain scans, such as CT, MRI, or PET (positron emission tomography), to support an Alzheimer’s diagnosis or to rule out other possible causes for symptoms.\\nThese tests may be repeated to give doctors information about how the person’s memory and other cognitive functions are changing over time.\\nPeople with memory and thinking concerns should talk to their doctor to find out whether their symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s or to another cause, such as stroke, tumor, Parkinson’s disease, sleep disturbances, side effects of medication, an infection, or another type of dementia. Some of these conditions may be treatable and, possibly, reversible.\\nIf the diagnosis is Alzheimer’s, beginning treatment as early as possible in the disease process may help preserve daily functioning for a while. An early diagnosis also helps families plan for the future. They can take care of financial and legal matters, address potential safety issues, learn about living arrangements, and develop support networks.\\nIn addition, an early diagnosis provides people with more opportunities to participate in clinical trials or studies testing possible new treatments for Alzheimer’s.\\nFor more information, visit How Is Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosed?\\nHow is Alzheimer’s disease treated?\\nAlzheimer’s is complex, and it is therefore unlikely that any one drug or other intervention will successfully treat it in all people living with the disease. In ongoing clinical trials, scientists are developing and testing several possible treatment interventions.\\nWhile there is currently no cure for Alzheimer’s, medications are emerging to treat the progression of the disease by targeting its underlying causes. There are also medications that may temporarily improve or stabilize memory and thinking skills in some people and may help manage certain symptoms and behavioral problems.\\nAdditionally, people with Alzheimer’s also may experience sleeplessness, depression, anxiety, agitation, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms. Scientists continue to research why these symptoms occur and are exploring new medications and non-drug strategies to manage them. Research shows that treating these symptoms may make people with Alzheimer’s feel more comfortable and also help their caregivers. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anti-anxiety drugs may be helpful for some people with Alzheimer’s, but experts agree that these medicines should be used only after other strategies to promote physical and emotional comfort, such as avoiding stressful situations, have been tried. It’s important to talk with a doctor about what treatment will be most effective in your situation.\\nFor more information, visit How Is Alzheimer's Disease Treated?\\nClinical trials on Alzheimer’s disease treatments\\nVolunteers are needed for clinical trials that are testing ways to treat Alzheimer’s. By joining one of these studies, you may help scientists discover new Alzheimer’s treatments and contribute useful information to help people living with Alzheimer's disease.\\nFind clinical trials near you\\nSupport for families and Alzheimer's disease caregivers\\nCaring for a person with Alzheimer’s can have significant physical, emotional, and financial costs. The demands of day-to-day care, changes in family roles, and decisions about placement in a care facility can be difficult. NIA supports efforts to evaluate programs, strategies, approaches, and other research to improve the quality of care and life for those living with dementia and their caregivers.\\nBecoming well-informed about the disease is one important long-term strategy. Programs that teach families about the various stages of Alzheimer’s and about ways to deal with difficult behaviors and other caregiving challenges can help.\\nGood coping skills, a strong support network, and respite care are other things that may help caregivers handle the stress of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s. For example, staying physically active provides physical and emotional benefits.\\nSome caregivers have found that joining a support group is a critical lifeline. These support groups enable caregivers to find respite, express concerns, share experiences, get tips, and receive emotional comfort. Many organizations sponsor in-person and online support groups, including groups for people with early-stage Alzheimer’s and their families.\\nFor more information, see Alzheimer’s Caregiving.\\nSign up for email updates\\nReceive weekly tips and resources on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias from NIA's Alzheimers.gov\\n*Email Address\\nFor more information about Alzheimer’s disease\\nNIA Alzheimer’s and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center\\n800-438-4380\\nadear@nia.nih.gov(link sends email)\\nwww.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers\\nThe NIA ADEAR Center offers information and free print publications about Alzheimer’s and related dementias for families, caregivers, and health professionals.

These early brain changes point to a possible window of opportunity to prevent or delay memory loss and other symptoms of dementia. While nothing has been proven yet to prevent Alzheimer’s, researchers have identified promising strategies and are learning more about what might — and might not — work.\\nOn this page:\\nBlood pressure management\\nIncreased physical activity\\nCognitive training\\nWhat does this mean for Alzheimer’s prevention?\\nRead and share this infographic and help spread the word about healthy lifestyle activities that may help reduce your risk of dementia.\\nA 2017 review of research(link is external) looked carefully at the evidence from clinical research on ways to prevent, delay, or slow Alzheimer’s and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or delay or slow age-related cognitive decline. Clinical trials are often considered to be the “gold standard” for providing the strongest level of evidence that a treatment or medical approach works. Led by a committee of experts from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), the review found “encouraging but inconclusive” evidence for three types of interventions: blood pressure management in people with high blood pressure, increased physical activity, and cognitive training.\\nWithin the context of this study, this meant that the three areas showed promise, but more results from clinical trials would be needed to determine whether these interventions could help prevent these conditions. Researchers are also continuing to explore other possible preventive and risk reduction strategies, including certain foods and diets, diabetes management, sleep quality interventions, and hearing restorative devices, for which we have some but not as much evidence.\\nThe video below highlights conclusions and recommendations from the NASEM review, and the following sections go into more depth on what we know about the most promising interventions to date.\\nBlood pressure management\\nControlling high blood pressure is known to reduce a person\\'s risk for heart disease and stroke, and it also might help prevent or delay Alzheimer\\'s. High blood pressure, particularly in midlife, is considered a risk factor for later-life cognitive decline.\\nA large, multiyear clinical trial called SPRINT-MIND (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial: Memory and Cognition in Decreased Hypertension) looked at the effects of lowering blood pressure in more than 8,000 older adults who were 50 years or older and at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Results showed that lowering systolic blood pressure (i.e., the “top” blood pressure number) to below 120 mmHg, rather than the standard 140 mmHg, significantly reduced the risk of MCI. Further, brain scans also showed that this intensive lowering slowed the buildup of white matter lesions — abnormal changes in the brain associated with dementia.\\nIn a study that reviewed data from six individual community-based cohorts, researchers examined the long-term data (average follow-up between seven and 22 years) from roughly 31,000 adults over age 55 that provided further evidence to support the potential of this strategy. The study results showed that managing high blood pressure with blood pressure medication reduced the risk of dementia to the level of a person with normal blood pressure not on blood pressure medication.\\nHowever, an observational study of more than 17,000 adults showed that higher systolic blood pressure (particularly at about 185 mmHg) was associated with a lower risk of dementia among those age 60 to 70, which is inconsistent with the findings from SPRINT-MIND. Among those 75 years and older, data showed what’s called a U-shaped association, in which both high and low blood pressure were associated with lower risk. These findings and others point to the need for further research in how blood pressure levels relate to dementia risk at different ages, as well as cardiovascular risk factors.\\nWhile research continues, experts recommend that people control high blood pressure to lower their risk of other serious health problems. Learn more about ways to control your blood pressure.\\nWhat do we know about diet and Alzheimer’s prevention?\\nPeople often wonder if a certain diet or specific foods can help prevent Alzheimer’s. The NASEM review of research(link is external) did not find enough evidence to recommend a certain diet, but some healthy eating patterns and diets have been associated with cognitive benefits. Learn more at What Do We Know About Diet and Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease?\\nIncreased physical activity\\nPhysical activity has many health benefits, such as reducing falls, maintaining mobility and independence, and promoting heart health. It reduces the risk of depression, diabetes, high blood pressure, and stroke — health conditions that can contribute to age-related cognitive decline.\\nYears of animal and human observational studies suggest that exercise may help with brain health and cognitive performance, or how well you think, learn, and remember. No clear link between physical activity and preventing Alzheimer’s has been documented. However, preliminary research findings suggest that physical activity may help reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline.\\nOne study compared cognitive performance in 454 older adults two years prior to death, on average at age 90, and found that higher levels of physical activity were associated with better cognitive function, even after accounting for signs of Alzheimer’s in participants’ brain tissue. In another study of 1,159 adults age 65 and older that included participants with high levels of tau protein (a hallmark of Alzheimer’s), those who engaged in more physical activity had a slower rate of cognitive decline.\\nWhile there is not enough evidence from clinical trials to conclude that exercise can prevent or slow MCI or Alzheimer’s, some studies suggest that it may help delay or slow age-related cognitive decline. For example, one study compared aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking or running on a treadmill, to stretching and balance exercises in 65 participants age 50 to 89 with MCI and prediabetes. After six months, the aerobic group had better executive function — the ability to plan and organize — than the stretching/balance group, but not better short-term memory.\\nResearchers continue to explore physical activity as a possible way to help prevent or delay Alzheimer’s. Many questions remain, including whether physical activity can prevent dementia, which types of physical activity, how much, and how often.\\nIn the meantime, it’s safe to say that experts already encourage exercise for its many benefits. Read more about exercise and physical activity for older adults or watch a video on the progress of research on exercise and brain health(link is external).\\nWhat do we know about hearing loss and Alzheimer’s prevention?\\nHearing loss has been linked to greater risk of developing dementia. A recent analysis of several studies found that people who used hearing restorative devices (such as hearing aids and cochlear implants) had a lower risk of long-term cognitive decline compared to people with uncorrected hearing loss. Additionally, a recent clinical trial showed that use of hearing aids reduced the rate of cognitive decline in older adults who were at higher risk for dementia. Learn more about hearing loss, its health effects, and devices to help.\\nCognitive training\\nThere is evidence suggesting cognitive training may help delay or slow age-related cognitive decline. Cognitive training involves structured activities designed to enhance memory, reasoning, and speed of processing.\\nStudies, such as the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) clinical trial, have shown that specific cognitive training can improve cognitive performance. ACTIVE was a large clinical trial which found that cognitive training improved the abilities of healthy older adults over age 65 (with an average age of 73 years at the start of the study), in the area in which they were trained: memory, reasoning, or speed of processing. Improvements remained in reasoning and speed of processing up to 10 years after the training was completed. It is still unknown whether the long-term benefits of cognitive training can help enable older people to live independently longer.\\nA separate analysis of 215 cognitive training clinical trials involving roughly 12,500 older adults showed that cognitive training improved cognition in cognitively healthy older adults and in those who have MCI. Additionally, participants who received training in multiple cognitive areas also improved in cognitive areas in which they had not received training. Cognitive training areas included memory, reasoning, speed of processing, executive functioning, everyday functioning, and general knowledge. Despite the promise of cognitive training, important questions remain around what types and aspects of trainings may be effective and how long the benefits last.\\nBe wary of claims that playing certain computer and online games can improve your memory and other types of thinking. There is currently not enough evidence available to suggest that any of the commercially offered computer-based brain training applications have the same impact on cognitive abilities as those seen in clinical trials. NIA and other organizations are supporting research to determine whether different types of cognitive training may have lasting effects.\\nInformal or unstructured cognitively stimulating activities, such as reading, may offer cognitive benefits, as well, according to findings from long-term observational studies. For example, a study of nearly 2,000 cognitively normal adults 70 and older found that playing games and engaging in craft, computer, and social activities were associated with a lower risk of MCI. The same research group also found that playing games and engaging in social activities in both midlife and late life and having a higher number of mentally stimulating activities in late life were associated with reduced MCI risk.\\nFurthermore, an analysis of 19 cognitive leisure activity studies showed a link between participation in unstructured cognitively stimulating activities and a reduced risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.\\nMany studies are ongoing to explore cognitive training as a possible way to prevent cognitive decline and dementia. For now, experts encourage people to make healthy lifestyle choices for cognitive health. Learn more about keeping your mind active.\\nBe cautious about Alzheimer\\'s \"cures\"\\nBecause Alzheimer\\'s is so devastating, some people are tempted by untried or unproven \"cures.\" Check with your doctor before trying pills or any other treatment or supplement that promises to prevent Alzheimer\\'s. These \"treatments\" might be unsafe, a waste of money, or both. They might even interfere with other medical treatments that have been prescribed.\\nWhat does this mean for Alzheimer\\'s prevention?\\nAlzheimer’s is complex, and the best strategy to prevent it may turn out to be a combination of interventions based on a person’s risk. In the meantime, generally leading a healthy lifestyle, including controlling high blood pressure, being physically active, and making healthy dietary choices, will help reduce your risk of many chronic health conditions and may help reduce your risk of dementia.\\nSocial connections are another important part of leading a healthy lifestyle. Staying connected with friends and family can improve your mental well-being and support healthy aging.\\nResearchers can’t say for certain whether making healthy lifestyle changes will protect against dementia, but taking these steps may help reduce your risk. Visit Alzheimers.gov to learn more about reducing your risk of dementia.\\nYou also can help researchers learn more by participating in research. Clinical trials and studies are looking for all kinds of people — healthy volunteers, cognitively normal participants with a family history of Alzheimer’s, people with mild cognitive impairment, and people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or a related dementia.

Do you worry about how to manage if you live alone? If so, these tips offer ways to help cope with changes in memory and thinking, prepare for the future, and stay active and engaged.\\nMake Everyday Tasks Easier\\nMany people with early-stage dementia continue to manage their everyday activities. But it’s important to look ahead to a time when performing daily tasks will be harder. The sooner you adopt new strategies to help you cope with changes, the more time you will have to adjust to them. Here are some tips:\\nOrganizing your days. Write down to-do lists, appointments, and events in a notebook or calendar. You can also keep track of activities with computer software or a smartphone app. Some people have an area in their home, such as an entryway table or bench, where they store important items or organize the things they need each day. You may also want to consider using a digital clock that displays the day of the week and date, in addition to the time.\\nPaying bills. Setting up automated payments is an easy way to pay your bills correctly and on time without having to write checks. Many companies and banks offer this service at no extra charge. You can set up automatic payments with your utility providers, insurance companies, bank, and mortgage company or leasing office. Also consider asking someone you trust to help you pay bills. That person could review your financial statements and ask you about anything unusual.\\nShopping for meals. Many stores offer grocery delivery services, usually for a small fee. You can also order fresh or frozen meals online or by phone.\\u202fMeals on Wheels America(link is external)\\u202f(888-998-6325) can deliver free or low-cost meals to your home, too, and this service sometimes includes a short visit and safety check. Other possible sources of meals include religious communities and senior centers. If you make your own meals at home, consider easy-to-prepare items, such as foods that you can heat in the microwave.\\nTaking medications. Several products can help you manage medications. You can try a weekly pillbox, a pillbox that gives you a notification (such as an alarm or vibration) when it’s time to take medicine, or an automatic medication dispenser. You can buy these items at a drugstore or online, but you may need someone to help you set these up. Or try an electronic reminder system, such as a smartphone app or an alarm you set on your phone or computer.\\nUsing transportation. If you drive, you may find that you become confused, get lost, or need help with directions more often than before. Talk with your doctor about these changes. If family or friends express concerns about your driving, take their concerns seriously. Some people\\u202fdecide to give up driving\\u202fand learn how to use public transportation or ride sharing. Neighbors, volunteers, or ride services for older adults may also be able to help with transportation.\\nFor more suggestions on living independently, see Aging in Place: Growing Older at Home.\\nFind Help in Your Community\\nTo learn about community-based support services, including food and transportation options:\\nContact the Eldercare Locator at 1-800-677-1116. This nationwide service from the Administration on Aging connects older Americans and their caregivers with local support resources.\\nSearch the website of your local or state government or tribal nation.\\nVisit the State Health Insurance Assistance Program or call 877-839-2675. This program, which has offices in each state, provides one-on-one counseling and assistance with Medicare, Medicaid, and related programs.\\nReach out to local social service agencies, community centers, senior centers, and religious communities.\\nScan Your Home for Safety\\nMaking minor changes in your home can create a safer environment. For example:\\nGet rid of unused items and extra furniture. If there are things you no longer use (such as clothing, appliances, decorations, and furniture), now is the time to remove them. Consider giving items to family and friends or donating items in good condition to a charity. Some organizations will pick items up from your home.\\nRemove items that you may trip over. Move electrical cords, pick up throw rugs, and look for other things you might trip over. Falls can cause injury and disability that may make it difficult to live alone. Read more about fall prevention.\\nInstall an automatic shut-off switch on the stove. This switch can help prevent a fire from starting if the stove is left on accidentally. If necessary, have your stove disabled. Consider using a microwave or cooking device with an automatic shut-off, such as a slow cooker or rice cooker, to heat up food.\\nSet the water heater at 120 °F. This setting will help you to avoid burns from scalding tap water and may help save money, too!\\nImprove bathroom safety. Add nonskid mats to showers and tubs. Also consider installing grab bars in the tub or shower. Add a nightlight in the bathroom or hallway and keep a flashlight near your bed for trips to the bathroom at night.\\nCarry identification with you. Medical ID bracelets and necklaces are helpful in case you get lost or need help. In an emergency, an ID can also let emergency responders know if you have allergies or special medical needs.\\nConsider getting safety devices to alert others in an emergency. Personal safety devices you may want to consider include fall monitors, emergency call buttons, and GPS tracking systems. Talk to your doctor or social worker about finding an alert system to notify family and friends if you fall, become ill, or get lost.\\nMake sure smoke and carbon monoxide detectors\\u202fare installed and working throughout your home. These detectors should be installed in or near the kitchen and all bedrooms. Set reminders to check the batteries every six months.\\nGet help with home maintenance and organization. Ask a family member or hire a professional service to help with tasks like managing clutter and making home repairs. Add labels to cabinets and drawers to make it easier to find flashlights, fire extinguishers, and other safety items quickly.\\nFor more home safety tips, read the Home Safety Checklist for Alzheimer’s Disease.\\nPrepare for the Future\\nPreparing for the future may be difficult to think about. But by starting discussions with family and friends early, everyone can help make decisions together. Talk about health and finances now, rather than later, to make sure you have a say in future decisions.\\nDiscuss decisions about health and finances as soon as possible to ensure that others, including your doctor and family, understand your preferences for your late-stage or end-of-life decisions. Other ways to prepare for the future include:\\nGet legal and financial matters in order as soon as possible.\\u202fPrepare or update your will, living will, and durable powers of attorney for health care and finances. If you need legal advice, call your lawyer, or contact the\\u202fNational Academy of Elder Law Attorneys(link is external)\\u202f(703-942-5711) to find an attorney. Be sure to let someone you trust know where your documents are kept or give them a copy. Read to learn more about advance care planning.\\nUnderstand your options for in-home care. Family members and friends may be able to help with everyday activities. If you need more help, look into options for a personal care assistant or home health care aide. Consider the costs of these services and whether any of the costs are covered by insurance. Check with your insurance provider(s) and resources like\\u202fBenefits.gov\\u202fand\\u202fBenefitsCheckUp(link is external) to find out about benefits you may qualify for. Learn more about long-term care and how to pay for it.\\nPlan for care when you can no longer live alone. There will likely come a time when you need more day-to-day care and support. Could a family member or caregiver move in with you? Or could you move in with them?\\u202fProfessional home care,\\u202fassisted living communities, and nursing homes\\u202fare other options.\\nIf you work, consider your options. You could share your diagnosis with your employer and discuss how to adjust your work. Under the\\u202fAmericans With Disabilities Act, employers with more than 15 employees are required to provide reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This might include changing your hours, getting reminders, or splitting up large tasks. Learn more about Alzheimer’s and employment(link is external).\\nFind out about potential disability benefits if you are no longer able to work. People with dementia may be eligible for disability income through private disability insurance (if you purchased this previously), Social Security, or\\u202fveterans’ benefits. A Social Security program called\\u202fCompassionate Allowances\\u202fensures quick review of disability benefit claims for people with conditions including early-onset Alzheimer’s and several other types of dementia.\\nStrengthen Your Support System\\nFamily members, friends, or other caregivers may be able to help in different ways. Here are some suggestions:\\nIdentify family and friends who can help. Talk to them about your diagnosis and ask if they\\u202fcan visit you regularly and be an emergency contact. Write down and save their phone numbers and other contact information in an obvious place, such as on your refrigerator door or in your wallet or mobile phone. Even family members who live far away can help. Read about\\u202flong-distance caregiving.\\nConsider sharing your diagnosis with neighbors you trust. Neighbors are often the first people to notice if someone is wandering or looks lost and they may be able to get help. Get tips for helping family and friends understand Alzheimer’s.\\nVisit a health care provider. Your primary care doctor, neurologist, or other specialist can track changes in your memory, thinking, and ability to complete everyday tasks. Ask the doctor to provide you with a care plan and write down directions (or have a family member or friend take notes during the visit). If getting to the doctor’s office is difficult, ask your doctor about home visits or telehealth appointments. The office may also be able to recommend home health care services or a\\u202fgeriatric care manager, a person who helps older people find services they need.\\nLearn about home- and community-based support and services. Social service agencies, local nonprofits, and\\u202fArea Agencies on Aging(link is external)\\u202fcan provide or refer you to in-home help, transportation, and meals to help you live at home. Call the\\u202fEldercare Locator\\u202f(800-677-1116) to learn about services in your area. Learn more about getting help with Alzheimer’s caregiving.\\nStay connected with technology. Smartphones, computers, and tablets can connect you with family and friends through video calls, email, and social media. You may want to get products that are easy to use, such as a telephone with pictures for dialing. Whatever technology you choose, start early so you can learn the system and establish a routine. Are you unfamiliar with technology? Ask your local library or community center about classes.\\nTalk with others who share your condition. Ask your doctor’s office or a social worker about support groups in your community or hosted by nonprofit organizations. For example, the\\u202fAlzheimer’s Association(link is external)\\u202fhas both online and in-person support groups and a 24-hour helpline (800-272-3900). Many NIA-supported\\u202fAlzheimer’s Disease Research Centers\\u202foffer programs and events for people with Alzheimer’s or a related dementia and their caregivers. Your community may also have a memory café — a place for people with dementia and their caregivers to enjoy activities and socialize.\\nGet urgent help if you need it. If you are experiencing depression or have thoughts of harming yourself, immediate help is available. Call or text the 24-hour 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline(link is external) at 988 or 800-273-TALK (800-273-8255). For TTY, use your preferred relay service or dial 711 then 988.\\nHow to help someone who lives alone with dementia\\nAre you concerned about a family member, neighbor, or friend who has been diagnosed with dementia and lives alone? It can be hard to know what the person needs or how to help. To get started, explore these NIA resources about caring for someone with Alzheimer’s or a related dementia.\\nYou can also contact the Eldercare Locator\\u202fat 800-677-1116 for guidance on resources and services in your community.\\nTake care of your physical and mental health\\nEating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and staying connected with others offer proven benefits for well-being. Here are some tips for taking care of your mind and body if you have early-stage dementia:\\nExercise.\\u202fYou don’t have to join a gym or spend a lot of money to be physically active. Even light housework, gardening, and walking around the neighborhood can have benefits. Experts recommend both aerobic exercise (such as walking) and strength training (such as lifting weights).\\u202fLearn more about physical activity for people with dementia.\\nEat right.\\u202fEating healthy foods helps everyone stay well, and it’s particularly important for people with dementia.\\u202fLearn more about healthy eating.\\nMake sleep a priority.\\u202fDementia often changes a person’s sleeping habits.

Many studies suggest that what we eat affects the aging brain’s ability to think and remember. These findings have led to research on general eating patterns and whether a person’s diet might make a difference.\\nHealthy eating patterns have been associated with cognitive benefits in studies, but more research is needed — and is underway — to determine if what we eat can prevent or delay Alzheimer’s or age-related cognitive decline.\\nHow could what we eat affect our brains? It’s possible that eating a certain diet affects biological mechanisms, such as oxidative stress and inflammation, that underlie Alzheimer’s. Eating a certain diet might increase specific nutrients that may protect the brain through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It may inhibit beta-amyloid deposits, which are found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, or improve cellular metabolism in ways that protect against the disease.\\nOr perhaps a person’s diet works indirectly by affecting other Alzheimer’s risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. For example, the typical Western diet increases cardiovascular disease risk, possibly contributing to faster brain aging. A growing area of research focuses on the relationship between gut microbes — tiny organisms in the digestive system — and aging-related processes that lead to Alzheimer’s. The important role of physical activity and exercise, and how this interacts with diet, cardiovascular health, and brain health must also be considered.\\nUnderstanding the Mediterranean and MIND diets\\nBefore starting any dietary change, it’s important to talk with your health care provider. They can provide personalized advice that accounts for your health history and medical conditions.\\nWith that in mind, there are two diets that research has shown may hold potential benefits for cognitive health, but the evidence is mixed.\\nThe Mediterranean diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, fish and other seafood, unsaturated fats such as olive oils, and low amounts of red meat, eggs, and sweets.\\nThe MIND (Mediterranean–DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet is a hybrid of the Mediterranean and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. Several studies have shown that treating and reducing high blood pressure may help reduce the risk of dementia. Similar to the Mediterranean diet, the MIND diet features vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables; berries over other fruit; whole grains; beans; nuts; one or more weekly servings of fish; and olive oil. It also limits servings of red meat, sweets, cheese, butter/margarine, and fast/fried food.\\nSome, but not all observational studies have shown that the Mediterranean and MIND diets are associated with a lower risk for dementia compared to a Western-style diet, which typically contains more red meat, saturated fats, and sugar.\\nHowever, a recent clinical trial assigned 600 older adults with a family history of dementia to either a MIND-diet group or a control-diet group. Results showed that participants who followed the MIND diet had only small improvements in cognition that were similar to those who followed a control diet of mild caloric restriction.\\nPrevious research on these diets points to their potential to slow cognitive decline, lower risk for dementia, and reduce related damage to the brain. Here’s a look at the evidence:\\nTo find out more on the diet and dementia connection, scientists continue to conduct clinical trials to shed more light on any cause and effect. (View a list of trials currently recruiting participants at the end of this article.)\\nObservational studies of more than 900 dementia-free older adults found that closely following the MIND diet was associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s and a slower rate of cognitive decline.\\nIn March 2023, scientists completed a study of the brains of about 600 older adults who died at an average age of 91. Brain autopsies found that people who had reported sticking to a Mediterranean or MIND diet showed less evidence of Alzheimer’s pathologies, including tau tangles and amyloid plaques.\\nIn one observational study of 116 cognitively normal adults, those who followed a Mediterranean diet had thicker cortical brain regions than those who did not. These brain regions shrink in people with Alzheimer’s, so having thicker regions could mean there’s a cognitive benefit.\\nA follow-up observational study showed lower glucose metabolism and higher levels of beta-amyloid protein — both seen in Alzheimer’s — in people who did not follow the Mediterranean diet closely, compared to those who did.\\nAn analysis of diet and other factors found that, after an average of 4.5 years, people who adhered most closely to the MIND diet had a 53% reduced rate of Alzheimer’s compared to those who did not follow the diet closely.\\nIn a similar study, following the MIND diet was associated with a substantial slowing of cognitive decline during an average of almost five years.\\nThe Age-Related Eye Disease Studies originally looked at diet and eye disease. Further analysis by the researchers showed that people who followed the Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of developing cognitive problems while maintaining a higher level of cognitive function.\\nWhat do we know about individual foods?\\nMany foods — blueberries, leafy greens, and curcumin (found in the spice turmeric), to name a few — have been studied for their potential cognitive benefit. These foods have been thought to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or other properties that might help protect the brain. However, so far, there is no evidence that eating or avoiding a specific food can prevent Alzheimer’s or age-related cognitive decline.\\nStill, scientists continue to look for clues. A recent study showed that a molecule in green tea breaks apart tangles of the protein tau, which builds up in the brain due to Alzheimer’s. Based on this finding, the team identified other potential Alzheimer’s drug candidates. Another study, based on older adults’ reports of their eating habits, found that eating a daily serving of leafy green vegetables such as spinach or kale was associated with slower age-related cognitive decline, perhaps due to the neuroprotective effects of certain nutrients.\\nResearch has also shown that a diet that includes regular fish consumption is associated with higher cognitive function and slower cognitive decline with age. Another recent study, in mice, found that consuming too much salt increased levels of the protein tau, found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, and caused cognitive impairment.\\nWhat about vitamins and supplements?\\nObservational study and clinical trial researchers have contemplated whether some over-the-counter vitamins and dietary supplements, including vitamins B and E and gingko biloba, might help prevent Alzheimer’s or cognitive decline. The speculation is that these dietary add-ons might attack oxidative damage or inflammation, protect nerve cells, or influence other biological processes involved in Alzheimer’s.\\nBut despite early findings of possible benefits for brain health, no vitamin or supplement has been proven to prevent Alzheimer’s in people. Overall, evidence remains weak because many studies were too small or too brief to be conclusive.\\nFor example, studies of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) in mice showed that this omega-3 fatty acid, found in salmon and certain other fish, reduced beta-amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. However, clinical trials in humans have had mixed results. In a study of 485 older adults with age-related cognitive decline, those who took a DHA supplement daily for 24 weeks showed improved learning and memory compared to those who took a placebo. Another study of 4,000 older adults — conducted primarily to study eye disease — concluded that taking omega-3 supplements, alone or with other supplements, did not slow cognitive decline.\\nAt this time, no vitamin or supplement is recommended for preventing Alzheimer’s or cognitive decline. However, a 2023 study showed that multivitamins helped boost memory test scores in older adults compared to participants who took a placebo. Additionally, a 2022 study showed that participants who took a daily multivitamin did better on a wide range of cognitive tests, and had significant improvements in memory and executive function (attention, planning, and organization) compared to those who did not take a daily multivitamin. Even so, these findings are still preliminary and more research is needed.\\nDespite ample availability, a broad range of other vitamins and supplements have not been tested for their effects on thinking. Their safety and effectiveness are largely unknown, and they may interact with other medications.\\nFor more information, visit the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health’s page on dietary supplements and cognitive function. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also has consumer information on diet and Alzheimer’s disease.\\nThe connection between the digestive system and the brain\\nThere is growing evidence for connections between the brain and the gut microbiome — the community of viruses, bacteria, and other microbes in the digestive system. NIA-funded investigators are analyzing how factors such as aging, diet, and the environment can change the conduit of neurons, proteins, and chemicals linking the digestive system and the brain, and how those changes may impact cognitive health. You can learn more about the latest research on how the gut microbiome relates to brain health in our recent feature article, “Beyond the brain: The gut microbiome and Alzheimer’s disease.”\\nResearchers continue to seek answers\\nInvestigators continue to expand explorations into potential diet and cognitive health connections. There is growing interest in the idea of Alzheimer’s as a metabolic disease that affects the brain, and the role of Alzheimer’s biomarkers — measurable indicators of biological processes in the body — such as glucose metabolism. In addition to the Mediterranean diet and its variations, investigators are looking at other diets as well as individual foods and nutrients.\\nFor example, the ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that prompts the production of ketones, chemicals that help brain cells work. A study in animal models and human tissue models showed that a ketogenic diet may help brain cells better use energy, improving their overall function. A recent, small pilot study of 10 participants who followed a keto diet for three months showed a statistically significant improvement in cognitive test scores among participants.\\nThere is also ongoing scientific interest in the potential health and lifespan benefits of intermittent fasting or caloric restriction. More research is needed to better understand how these eating patterns may affect insulin resistance, and brain/cognitive health as we age.\\nThese clinical trials are recruiting participants to test dietary interventions:\\nTherapeutic Diets in Alzheimer’s Disease (TDAD) — Tracking the impact of a ketogenic diet on cognition in adults age 50 to 90.\\nEnhanced Mediterranean Diet for Alzheimer’s Disease Prevention — Cognitively normal adults age 65 and older in Kansas City, Kansas, are randomly assigned to either a Mediterranean diet or a low-fat diet to gauge the impact on cognitive function, brain volume, and other measures.\\nMulticultural Healthy Diet to Reduce Cognitive Decline — This 18-month trial will investigate whether an anti-inflammatory diet tailored to a multicultural population in Bronx, New York, can improve cognitive functioning.\\nBrain Energy for Amyloid Transformation in Alzheimer’s Disease — Older adults with mild cognitive impairment in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, are randomly assigned to follow either a modified Mediterranean ketogenic (low-carbohydrate/high-fat) diet or an American Heart Association high-carb/low-fat diet for 16 weeks, with follow-up to assess effects on cognition and Alzheimer’s biomarkers.\\nTo learn more or to find a trial near you, visit the Alzheimers.gov Clinical Trials Finder.\\nYou may also be interested in\\nLearning more about vitamins and supplements\\nExploring healthy eating, nutrition, and diet\\nUnderstanding cognitive health for older adults\\nSign up for e-alerts about healthy aging\\n*Email Address\\nFor more information about Alzheimer’s prevention\\nNIA Alzheimer’s and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center\\n800-438-4380\\nadear@nia.nih.gov(link sends email)\\nwww.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers\\nThe NIA ADEAR Center offers information and free print publications about Alzheimer’s and related dementias for families, caregivers, and health professionals.

In most people with the disease — those with the late-onset type symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. Early-onset Alzheimer’s occurs between a person’s 30s and mid-60s and is very rare. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia among older adults.\\nShare this infographic and help spread the word about understanding different types of dementia.\\nThe disease is named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer. In 1906, Dr. Alzheimer noticed changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness. Her symptoms included memory loss, language problems, and unpredictable behavior. After she died, he examined her brain and found many abnormal clumps (now called amyloid plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers (now called neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles).\\nThese plaques and tangles in the brain are still considered some of the main features of Alzheimer’s disease. Another feature is the loss of connections between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Neurons transmit messages between different parts of the brain, and from the brain to muscles and organs in the body. Many other complex brain changes are thought to play a role in Alzheimer’s, too.\\nThis damage initially takes place in parts of the brain involved in memory, including the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. It later affects areas in the cerebral cortex, such as those responsible for language, reasoning, and social behavior. Eventually, many other areas of the brain are damaged.\\nHow many Americans have Alzheimer’s disease?\\nEstimates vary, but experts suggest that more than 6 million Americans age 65 and older may have Alzheimer’s. Many more under age 65 also have the disease. Unless Alzheimer's can be effectively treated or prevented, the number of people with it will increase significantly if current population trends continue. This is because increasing age is the most important known risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.\\nWhat does Alzheimer’s disease look like?\\nMemory problems are typically one of the first signs of Alzheimer’s, though initial symptoms may vary from person to person. A decline in other aspects of thinking, such as finding the right words, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning or judgment, may also signal the very early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition that can be an early sign of Alzheimer’s, but not everyone with MCI will develop the disease.\\nPeople with Alzheimer’s have trouble doing everyday things like driving a car, cooking a meal, or paying bills. They may ask the same questions over and over, get lost easily, lose things or put them in odd places, and find even simple things confusing. As the disease progresses, some people become worried, angry, or violent.\\nHow long can a person live with Alzheimer’s disease?\\nAlzheimer’s disease is currently ranked as the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, but the time from diagnosis to death varies. It may be as little as three or four years if the person is older than 80 when diagnosed, to as long as 10 or more years if the person is younger.\\nCurrently, there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, though there has been significant progress in recent years in developing and testing new treatments. Several medicines have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat people with Alzheimer’s.\\nLearn more about how Alzheimer's disease is treated.\\nYou may also be interested in\\nReading more about the signs of Alzheimer's disease\\nExploring myths and facts about Alzheimer's disease\\nLearning more about different types of dementia\\nSign up for email updates\\nReceive weekly tips and resources on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias from NIA's Alzheimers.gov\\n*Email Address\\nFor more information about Alzheimer's disease\\nNIA Alzheimer’s and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center\\n800-438-4380\\nadear@nia.nih.gov(link sends email)\\nwww.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers\\nThe NIA ADEAR Center offers information and free print publications about Alzheimer’s and related dementias for families, caregivers, and health professionals.

Too much APP protein leads to a buildup of protein clumps called\\u202fbeta-amyloid plaques\\u202fin the brain. The presence of beta-amyloid plaques is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.\\nBy age 40, most people with Down syndrome have these plaques, along with other protein deposits, called tau tangles, which cause problems with how brain cells function and increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s symptoms. Estimates suggest that 50% or more of people with Down syndrome will develop dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease as they age.\\nThis type of Alzheimer’s in people with Down syndrome is not passed down genetically from a parent to a child.\\nDown Syndrome and Alzheimer's Research\\nScientists are working hard to understand why some people with Down syndrome develop dementia while others do not. They want to know how Alzheimer’s disease begins and progresses so they can develop drugs or other treatments that can stop, delay, or even prevent the disease process. They are also hopeful that research on Alzheimer's and Down syndrome will not only help those with both conditions, but also may lead to effective treatments for all people with Alzheimer's. Research in this area includes:\\nBasic studies to improve understanding of the genetic and biological causes of brain abnormalities that lead to Alzheimer’s\\nObservational research to measure cognitive changes in people over time\\nStudies of biomarkers (biological signs of disease), brain scans, and other tests that may help diagnose Alzheimer’s — even before symptoms appear — and show brain changes as people with Down syndrome age\\nClinical trials to test treatments for dementia in adults with Down syndrome\\nThe Alzheimer's Biomarkers Consortium - Down Syndrome (ABC-DS) is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded research initiative to find biomarkers that indicate Alzheimer's disease is developing or progressing, and to track the Alzheimer's process in people with Down syndrome.\\nAlzheimer’s and Down Syndrome Research Highlight\\nOne ABC-DS study found disruptions in the way cells process and break down energy in people with Down syndrome who had Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment. Researchers measured these metabolic changes in the blood and found that they increased based on disease stage. Findings suggest that measuring such metabolic factors could be a potential way to track the disease.\\nIn 2018, NIH launched the INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) project to address health and quality-of-life needs for people with Down syndrome. Through INCLUDE-supported studies, researchers are exploring connections between Down syndrome and other conditions including Alzheimer’s, autism, cataracts, celiac disease, congenital heart disease, and diabetes.\\nAlzheimer's Disease and Down Syndrome\\nBob volunteers for Alzheimer's clinical trials because his daughter has Down syndrome.

Is it in your genes? This question isn’t easy to answer. Researchers have identified several genetic variants that are associated with Alzheimer’s and may increase or decrease a person’s risk of developing the disease. What does that mean? Let’s first learn about the role of genes.\\nWhat are genes?\\nHuman cells contain the instructions needed for a cell to do its job. These instructions are made up of DNA, which is packed tightly into structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome has thousands of segments called genes.\\nGenes are passed down from a person’s biological parents. They carry information that defines traits such as eye color and height. Genes also play a role in keeping the body’s cells healthy.\\nVariations in genes — even small changes to a gene — can affect the likelihood of a person developing a disease such as Alzheimer’s.\\nDo changes in genes cause diseases?\\nPermanent changes in one or more specific genes are called genetic variants. Some of these variants are quite common in the human population. While most genetic variants don’t cause diseases, some do. In some cases, a person inherits a genetic variant that will almost certainly lead to that individual developing a disease. Sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and some cases of early-onset Alzheimer’s are examples of inherited genetic disorders. However, other variants may simply increase, or even decrease, a person’s risk of developing that disease. Identifying genetic variants and their effects can help researchers uncover the most effective ways to treat or prevent diseases in an individual.\\nAdditionally, factors such as exercise, diet, chemicals, or smoking can have positive or negative effects by changing the way certain genes work. In the field of epigenetics, researchers are studying how such factors can alter a cell’s DNA in ways that affect gene activity.\\nGenetic research is a component of precision medicine, an emerging approach that considers individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle. Precision medicine will enable researchers and doctors to predict more accurately which treatment and prevention strategies will work in particular groups of people.\\nGenes and Alzheimer's disease\\nShare this infographic and help spread the word about Alzheimer's genetics.\\nIn most cases, Alzheimer’s does not have a single genetic cause. Instead, it can be influenced by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. Consequently, a person may carry more than one genetic variant or group of variants that can either increase or reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s.\\nImportantly, people who develop Alzheimer’s do not always have a history of the disease in their families. Still, those who have a parent or sibling diagnosed with the disease have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s than those without that association.\\nGenetic variants that affect Alzheimer's disease risk\\nIn 2010, we knew of just 10 genetic areas associated with Alzheimer’s. Today, thanks in large part to the work of NIH-funded researchers, we know of at least 80 genetic areas associated with this disease. Understanding which genes play a role — and what role they play — may help identify new methods to prevent, delay, or treat dementia.\\nOne well-known gene that influences Alzheimer’s risk is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. The APOE gene is involved in making a protein that helps carry cholesterol and other types of fat in the bloodstream. Problems in this process are thought to contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s. APOE comes in several forms, called alleles (e.g., ε2, ε3).\\nAPOE ε2 may provide some protection against the disease. If Alzheimer’s occurs in a person with this allele, it usually develops later in life than it would in someone with the APOE ε4 gene. Roughly 5% to 10% of people have this allele.\\nAPOE ε3, the most common allele, is believed to have a neutral effect on the disease — neither decreasing nor increasing risk of Alzheimer’s.\\nAPOE ε4 increases risk for Alzheimer’s and is associated with an earlier age of disease onset in certain populations. About 15% to 25% of people have this allele, and 2% to 5% carry two copies.\\nEach person inherits two APOE alleles, one from each biological parent, meaning people can have one of six possible combinations: 2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 3/3, 3/4, and 4/4. Having two copies of APOE ε4 is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s than having one copy. While inheriting APOE ε4 increases a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s, some people with an APOE ε4 allele never develop the disease.\\nResearchers are also finding other rare genetic variants, in addition to APOE ε2, that appear to provide some protection against developing Alzheimer’s.\\nHowever, prevalence and risk associated with APOE and other genetic variants may not be the same across all population groups. Research suggests that the degree of risk may be affected by genetic ancestry — the global geographic region from which a person is biologically descended — and differ among people of African, Asian, American Indian, and European descent. More research is needed to better understand how certain genetic variants might affect a person’s or group’s risk for Alzheimer’s and to identify treatment and prevention strategies that will work best for that particular group.\\nGenetic variants that cause Alzheimer's disease\\nOf the genetic variants so far associated with Alzheimer’s, three rare single-gene variants are known to cause the disease:\\nAmyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21\\nPresenilin 1 (PSEN1) on chromosome 14\\nPresenilin 2 (PSEN2) on chromosome 1\\nA child whose biological parent carries a genetic variant for one of these three genes has a 50/50 chance of inheriting that altered version of the gene. If the variant is inherited, the child has a very strong probability of developing Alzheimer’s before age 65 and sometimes much earlier. When someone develops Alzheimer’s before age 65, it’s known as “early-onset Alzheimer’s” or sometimes “younger-onset Alzheimer’s” or “earlier-onset Alzheimer’s.” Less than 10% of all people with Alzheimer’s develop symptoms this early. Of those who do, 10% to 15% can be attributed to changes in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2.\\nChanges in these three genes result in the production of abnormal proteins that are associated with the disease. Each of these mutations contributes to the breakdown of APP, a protein that’s function isn’t completely understood. The breakdown of APP is part of a process that makes harmful forms of sticky amyloid fragments. These fragments cluster to form plaques in the brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s.\\nIn addition to the three genetic variants that are known to cause Alzheimer’s, people with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, which carries the APP gene, and a higher risk of developing early-onset Alzheimer’s. Estimates suggest that 50% or more of people living with Down syndrome will develop Alzheimer’s with symptoms appearing in their 50s and 60s. Learn more about Alzheimer’s disease in people with Down syndrome.\\nGenetic testing for Alzheimer's disease\\nGenetic tests are not routinely used in clinical settings to diagnose or predict the risk of developing Alzheimer’s or a related dementia.\\nIn some cases, if a person has symptoms at an early age with a strong family history of Alzheimer’s, a neurologist or other medical specialist may order a genetic test for APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2.\\nAlthough APOE testing is also available, the results cannot fully predict who will or won’t develop Alzheimer’s. Rather, this type of testing is used primarily in research settings to identify study participants who may have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s. This approach helps scientists look for early brain changes(link is external) and compare the effectiveness of possible treatments for people with different APOE profiles.\\nSome people learn their APOE status through consumer genetic testing. These products are available for a fee and provide some information around the results and what they mean. While at-home genetic tests are convenient, people considering them may also benefit from talking with a doctor or genetic counselor to better understand this type of test and their test results.\\nGeneral information about genetic testing can be found at:\\nGenetic Testing\\nWhat is Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing?\\nGetting a Genetic Test\\nGenetic Testing FAQ\\nUnderstanding Alzheimer's genetics in diverse populations\\nResearch shows the rates of dementia vary among different racial and ethnic groups. While the concepts of race and ethnicity are socially defined, these social definitions offer researchers another way of looking at risk factors that may affect certain groups. These risk factors can include external influences, such as the environment, education, and income levels, as well as biological factors like genetics.\\nOne way researchers are using genetics to advance health disparities research is to look at genetic ancestry. Genetic ancestry refers to the region from which a person is biologically descended. People of the same race and ethnicity may share genetic ancestry, but this is not always the case. Large genetic research studies can help scientists identify unique factors that are linked to genetic ancestry. Understanding these factors in diverse populations is important to identifying ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat Alzheimer’s in all people.\\nAlzheimer’s genetics research\\nDiscovering as much as possible about the role of Alzheimer’s genetic risk and protective factors across populations is an important area of research. NIA funds several major genetics research programs. Understanding more about the genetic basis of the disease will help researchers:\\nAnswer a number of basic questions, such as: What makes the disease process begin? Why do some people with memory and other thinking problems develop Alzheimer’s while others don’t?\\nDetermine how genetic risk and protective factors may interact with other genes and lifestyle or environmental influences to affect Alzheimer’s risk in any one person.\\nIdentify people who are at high risk of developing Alzheimer’s so they can benefit from new interventions and treatments as much and as soon as possible.\\nExplain differences in Alzheimer’s risks and protections among racial groups and genders.\\nUse individual gene discoveries to develop potential therapies to prevent or treat the disease.\\nResearch needs volunteers of all different races, ethnicities, ancestries, ages, and genders to participate in clinical trials and studies.

They may struggle to find words or forget what they want to say. You may feel impatient and wish they could just say what they want, but they can’t.\\nThe person with Alzheimer’s may have problems with:\\nFinding the right word or losing his or her train of thought when speaking\\nUnderstanding what words mean\\nPaying attention during long conversations\\nRemembering the steps in common activities, such as cooking a meal, paying bills, or getting dressed\\nBlocking out background noises from the radio, TV, or conversations\\nFrustration if communication isn’t working\\nBeing very sensitive to touch and to the tone and loudness of voices\\nAlso, Alzheimer’s disease causes some people to get confused about language. For example, the person might forget or no longer understand English if it was learned as a second language. Instead, he or she might understand and use only the first language learned, such as Spanish.\\nHelp make communication easier\\nThe first step is to understand that the disease causes changes in communication skills. The second step is to try some tips that may make communication easier:\\nMake eye contact and call the person by name.\\nBe aware of your tone, how loud your voice is, how you look at the person, and your body language.\\nEncourage a two-way conversation for as long as possible.\\nUse other methods besides speaking, such as gentle touching.\\nTry distracting the person if communication creates problems.\\nTo encourage the person to communicate with you:\\nShow a warm, loving, matter-of-fact manner.\\nHold the person’s hand while you talk.\\nBe open to the person’s concerns, even if he or she is hard to understand.\\nLet him or her make some decisions and stay involved.\\nBe patient with angry outbursts. Remember, it’s the illness “talking.”\\nTo speak effectively with a person who has Alzheimer’s:\\nOffer simple, step-by-step instructions.\\nRepeat instructions and allow more time for a response. Try not to interrupt.\\nDon’t talk about the person as if he or she isn’t there.\\nDon’t talk to the person using “baby talk” or a “baby voice.”\\nBe direct, specific, and positive\\nHere are some examples of what you can say:\\nRead and share this infographic about how to communicate with a person who has Alzheimer\\'s disease.\\n“Let’s try this way,” instead of pointing out mistakes.\\n“Please do this,” instead of “Don’t do this.”\\n“Thanks for helping,” even if the results aren’t perfect.\\nYou also can:\\nAsk questions that require a yes or no answer. For example, you could say, “Are you tired?” instead of “How do you feel?”\\nLimit the number of choices. For example, you could say, “Would you like a hamburger or chicken for dinner?” instead of “What would you like for dinner?”\\nUse different words if he or she doesn\\'t understand the first time. For example, if you ask the person whether he or she is hungry and you don’t get a response, you could say, “Dinner is ready now. Let’s eat.”\\nTry not to say, “Don’t you remember?” or “I told you.”\\nIf you become frustrated, take a timeout for yourself.\\nHelping a person who is aware of memory loss\\nAlzheimer’s disease is being diagnosed at earlier stages. This means that many people are aware of how the disease is affecting their memory. Here are tips on how to help someone who knows that he or she has memory problems:\\nTake time to listen. The person may want to talk about the changes he or she is noticing.\\nBe as sensitive as you can. Don\\'t just correct the person every time he or she forgets something or says something odd. Try to understand that it\\'s a struggle for the person to communicate.\\nBe patient when someone with Alzheimer\\'s disease has trouble finding the right words or putting feelings into words.\\nHelp the person find words to express thoughts and feelings. But be careful not to put words in the person’s mouth or “fill in the blanks” too quickly. For example, Mrs. D cried after forgetting her garden club meeting. She finally said, \"I wish they stopped.\" Her daughter said, \"You wish your friends had stopped by for you.\" Mrs. D nodded and repeated some of the words. Then Mrs. D said, \"I want to go.\" Her daughter said, \"You want to go to the garden club meeting.\" Again, Mrs. D nodded and repeated the words.\\nBe aware of nonverbal communication. As people lose the ability to talk clearly, they may rely on other ways to communicate their thoughts and feelings. For example, their facial expressions may show sadness, anger, or frustration. Grasping at their undergarments may tell you they need to use the bathroom.\\nYou may also be interested in\\nGetting tips for managing personality and behavior changes in Alzheimer\\'s\\nLearning ways to adapt activities for people with Alzheimer\\'s\\nFinding resources for getting help with Alzheimer\\'s caregiving\\nFor more information about Alzheimer\\'s and changes in communication skills\\nNIA Alzheimer’s and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center\\n800-438-4380\\nadear@nia.nih.gov(link sends email)\\nwww.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers\\nThe NIA ADEAR Center offers information and free print publications about Alzheimer’s and related dementias for families, caregivers, and health professionals.

English\\n本頁內容:\\n阿茲海默病如何影響大腦?\\n阿茲海默病的體征和症狀\\n阿茲海默病的各個階段\\n阿茲海默病的病因是什麼?\\n如何診斷阿茲海默病?\\n如何治療阿茲海默病?\\n為家人和阿茲海默病看護者提供的支援\\n阿茲海默病是一種大腦疾病，它會慢慢破壞病人的記憶力和思維能力，最終使病人失去執行最簡單任務的能力。大多數的阿茲海默病病人是在進入老年後開始出現症狀的。儘管有各種估計值，但專家認為有超過6百萬的美國人，其中大多數年齡在65歲或以上，可能患有阿茲海默病。\\n在美國，阿茲海默病目前被列為第七大死亡原因，而且是造成老年人失智症的最常見原因。\\n失智症又名失智，有時被稱為癡呆。它會導致病人失去認知功能（思考、記憶和推理）和行為能力，以至於會影響日常生活和活動。失智症的嚴重程度不等，從一個人的身體功能剛剛開始受到影響的最輕微階段，到必須完全依賴他人的幫助才能完成基本日常起居活動的最嚴重階段。\\n失智症的病因各有不同，具體取決於大腦可能發生的變化的類型。其他形式的失智症包括路易體失智症（英文版）、額顳葉失智症（英文版）和血管性失智症（英文版）。混合型失智症（英文版）較為常見，這是指混合兩類或更多類型的失智症。例如，有些人同時患有阿茲海默病和血管性失智症。\\n阿茲海默病是以愛羅斯·阿茲海默醫生的名字命名的。在1906年，阿茲海默醫生注意到一位死於罕見精神疾病的女性的大腦組織發生了變化。她的症狀包括記憶力衰退、語言問題和不可預測的行為。在她去世後，阿茲海默醫生檢查了她的大腦，發現了很多異常的斑塊（現在稱為澱粉樣蛋白斑）和纏結的纖維束（現在稱為神經纖維纏結或濤蛋白纏結）。\\n大腦內的這些斑塊和纏結至今仍然被視為阿茲海默病的一些主要特徵。阿茲海默病的另一個特徵是大腦神經元之間的連接減少。神經元負責在大腦區域之間傳遞資訊，並且將資訊從大腦傳遞到身體的肌肉和器官。\\n參與阿茲海默病的臨床試驗\\n包括阿茲海默病病人、輕度認知障礙病人，以及無論有無阿茲海默病家族史的健康志願者在內所有人都可以參加臨床試驗和研究。參加阿茲海默病的臨床研究可以幫助科學家了解健康衰老的大腦和患有阿茲海默病的大腦會發生什麼樣的變化。\\n數以百計的臨床試驗和研究正在進行中，需要非常多的志願者參加。這些臨床試驗和研究在測試更好了解、診斷、治療和預防阿茲海默病的方法。研究人員需要不同年齡、性別、種族和族裔的參加者，以確保研究結果對很多人都有意義。如需臨床試驗的詳情，觀看NIH國家醫學圖書館的這段錄影（英文版）。\\nNIA領導聯邦政府有關阿茲海默病的研究工作。NIA在美國各地資助的阿茲海默病研究中心（英文版）開展廣泛的研究工作，包括對阿茲海默病的病因、診斷和管理的臨床試驗和研究。NIA還主辦阿茲海默病臨床試驗聯盟（英文版）。該聯盟的宗旨是加快和拓展阿茲海默病及相關失智症的研究和治療。\\n如需阿茲海默病臨床試驗和研究的詳情：\\n向您的醫療服務提供者詢問當地可能適合您參加的研究。\\n在Alzheimers.gov臨床試驗查找工具（英文版）中尋找您附近的臨床試驗，或者註冊接收電子郵件警示（英文版），了解新的試驗和研究。\\n報名參加登記名冊或匹配服務（英文版），以便獲得邀請參加試驗和研究。\\n聯繫阿茲海默病研究中心或您所在社區的記憶或神經內科診所。\\n更多了解參加臨床試驗（英文版）。觀看錄影（英文版），聽一聽阿茲海默病臨床試驗的參加者分享他們的體驗。\\n阿茲海默病如何影響大腦\\n科學家們在不斷揭示阿茲海默病病人複雜的大腦變化。大腦可能在症狀出現的十年之前甚至更早就發生了變化。在阿茲海默病的這個非常早期的階段，大腦發生有害的變化，包括形成澱粉樣蛋白斑和濤蛋白纏結的蛋白質異常積聚。之前健康的神經元停止工作，失去與其他神經元的連接，進而死亡。許多其他複雜的大腦變化也被認為在阿茲海默病中起到了作用。\\n起初的損害似乎是發生在海馬和內嗅皮層。大腦的這兩個部分對於形成記憶至關重要。隨著更多的神經元死亡，大腦的其他部分也受到影響，並且開始萎縮。在阿茲海默病的最後階段，受損範圍廣泛，大腦組織嚴重萎縮。\\n阿茲海默病的體征和症狀\\n記憶問題（英文版）通常是阿茲海默病最先出現的相關認知障礙體征之一。一些有記憶問題的人士患有名為輕度認知障礙（英文簡稱MCI）的病症。有輕度認知障礙的人士與正常同齡人相比有更多的記憶力問題，但他們的症狀不會干擾日常生活。行動困難和嗅覺問題（英文版）也與輕度認知障礙有關。有輕度認知障礙的老年人有更大的風險患上阿茲海默病，但不是所有有輕度認知障礙的人都會患上阿茲海默病。有些人甚至可能會恢復正常認知。\\n阿茲海默病最先出現的症狀因人而異。對許多人來說，非記憶認知能力的下降，例如找詞、視力/空間問題和推理或判斷能力受損，可能表示處於疾病的非常早期階段。研究人員在研究生物標誌物（英文版）（在大腦影像、腦脊液和血液中找到的疾病的生物標誌），以發現輕度認知障礙病人，以及認知正常但可能有較高風險患上阿茲海默病的人士大腦早期發生的變化。還需要開展更多的研究，才能廣泛地在醫療服務提供者的診所內常規性使用這些技術來診斷阿茲海默病。\\n阿茲海默病的各個階段\\n輕度阿茲海默病\\n隨著阿茲海默病的惡化，會出現更嚴重的記憶力衰退和其他認知困難。問題可包括漫遊（英文版）和迷路、難以處理金錢和支付帳單（英文版）、重複提問、完成日常任務的時間延長和性格與行為變化（英文版）。病人常常在這一階段得到診斷。\\n中度阿茲海默病\\n在這一階段，大腦控制語言、推理、意識思維和感覺處理（例如正確感知聲音和氣味的能力）的區域受損。記憶力衰退和意識混亂變得更加嚴重，而且病人開始認不出家人和朋友。他們可能無法學習新事物，也無法執行需要多個步驟的任務（例如穿衣）或者應對新的情況。此外，病人在這個階段可能會有幻覺、妄想和偏執（英文版），而且可能行為衝動。\\n重度阿茲海默病\\n最終，斑塊和纏結會遍佈整個大腦，大腦組織嚴重萎縮。重度阿茲海默病病人無法與人交流，而且完全依賴他人的照顧。在接近生命終點時（英文版），隨著身體停止工作，病人可能會在大部分的時間或者全天躺在床上。\\n阿茲海默病的病因是什麼\\n近年來，科學家們已經在更好了解阿茲海默病方面取得了重大進展，而且研究的勢頭還在繼續增長。然而，科學家們仍然未能完全了解對於大多數人而言，阿茲海默病的病因是什麼（英文版）。病因很有可能包括年齡相關大腦變化的組合，以及基因、環境和生活方式等因素。以上任何一個因素對於增加或降低阿茲海默病患病風險的重要性可能會因人而異。\\n阿茲海默病的基本知識\\n科學家在進行各種研究，以更多了解斑塊、纏結和阿茲海默病的其他生物學特徵。大腦成像技術的進步讓研究人員可以觀察活體大腦內異常澱粉樣蛋白和濤蛋白的生成與擴散，以及大腦結構和功能的變化。科學家還在研究在阿茲海默病症狀出現之前數年就可以檢測出的大腦和體液變化，從而探索疾病過程中非常早期的步驟。這些研究的結果會有助於提高我們對阿茲海默病病因的了解並且讓診斷更加容易。\\n有關阿茲海默病的一大謎團是為何罹患該病的大多數是老年人。對正常老化大腦的研究工作正在探索這一問題。例如，科學家正在研究年齡相關的大腦變化可能會如何損害神經元並影響其他類型的腦細胞，從而促成阿茲海默病的損害。這些年齡相關變化包括大腦某些部分的萎縮（縮小）、炎症、血管受損、產生名為自由基的不穩定分子以及線粒體功能障礙（細胞內能量生成的分解）。\\n阿茲海默症的遺傳學\\n在大多數的情況下，阿茲海默病並沒有單個致病基因。相反，該病很有可能是受到多個基因以及生活方式和環境因素的影響。基因變化（稱為基因變異）可能會增加或降低阿茲海默病的患病風險。\\n科學家們目前知道，有80多個遺傳區段與阿茲海默病有關。在目前為止與阿茲海默病相關的基因變異中，已知只有三個基因變異會導致阿茲海默病。儘管很少發生，但如果遺傳了這些基因（APP、PSEN1或PSEN2）中的某一種變異，則很有可能在65歲之前，有時甚至還要早很多，就患上阿茲海默病。\\n唐氏綜合征病人也有更高的風險在更年輕的時候患上阿茲海默病。唐氏綜合症的病因是多了一條21號染色體，而這條染色體上帶有產生澱粉樣蛋白前體蛋白的APP基因。這種蛋白質過多會導致大腦內β澱粉樣蛋白斑積聚。估計有50%或更多的唐氏綜合征病人會患上阿茲海默病，並且會在五六十歲出現症狀。\\n另一種具有數種形式的APOE基因變異已知會影響阿茲海默病的患病風險。具體而言，APOE ε4會增加阿茲海默病的患病風險，而且還與某些群體在更年輕的時候患上阿茲海默病有關。APOE ε2可能會針對阿茲海默病提供一定程度的保護。\\n不同基因發生的變化，以及其他生物醫學、生活方式和環境因素，都會對可能患上阿茲海默病產生影響。儘管如此，從來都無法有把握地判定一個人是否會患上阿茲海默病\\n如需更多了解阿茲海默病的基因研究，請參閱NIA的阿茲海默病遺傳學簡明資料（英文版）。\\n健康、環境和生活方式因素\\n研究顯示，有多種遺傳學之外的因素可能會影響阿茲海默病的發展和病程。比如說，研究人員非常想知道認知能力下降與血管病症（例如心臟病（英文版）、中風（英文版）和高血壓（英文版）），以及代謝疾病（例如糖尿病（英文版）和肥胖症）之間的關係。持續進行的研究會幫助我們了解，降低這些病症的風險因素（英文版）是否也有可能降低阿茲海默病的患病風險以及如何降低阿茲海默病的患病風險\\n營養飲食（英文版）、運動身體（英文版）、社會交往（英文版）和鍛煉腦力的活動都可以幫助人們在衰老的同時保持健康。這些因素還可能有助於降低出現認知能力下降和阿茲海默病的風險。研究人員目前正在臨床試驗中測試其中的一些可能性。\\n如何診斷阿茲海默病\\n醫生使用數種方法和工具來幫助判斷出現記憶問題的人是否病人阿茲海默病。\\n要診斷阿茲海默病，醫生可能會：\\n向病人及家人或朋友詢問總體健康狀況、處方藥和非處方藥的使用情況、飲食、過往的病症、執行日常活動的能力以及行為和性格的變化。\\n測試記憶力、問題解決能力、注意力、計數和語言。\\n下達醫囑接受驗血、驗尿和其他標準醫學檢測，以幫助發現問題的其他可能原因。\\n進行測試以判斷是否存在抑鬱或其他心理健康病症導致或助長了症狀。\\n透過脊椎穿刺採集腦脊液或者下達醫囑驗血，以測量與阿茲海默病和相關失智症有關聯的蛋白質含量。\\n進行腦部掃描，例如CT、MRI或PET（正電子發射斷層掃描），以支援阿茲海默病的診斷或排除症狀的其他可能原因。\\n可能會重複進行這些檢測，以便為醫生提供資訊，了解病人的記憶力和其他認知功能是如何隨時間而變化的。\\n有記憶力和思維問題的人應該詢問自己的醫生，查明造成這些症狀的是阿茲海默病還是其他原因，例如中風（英文版）、腫瘤、帕金森氏症（英文版）、睡眠障礙（英文版）、藥物副作用（英文版）、感染或其他類型的失智症（英文版）。其中一些病症是可以治療的，而且有可能逆轉。\\n如果確診為阿茲海默病（英文版），在疾病過程中儘快開始治療可以幫助病人在一段時間保持日常生活的能力。早日得到診斷也可以幫助家人規劃未來。他們可以處理財務和法律事務（英文版）、解決潛在的安全問題（英文版）、了解居住安排（英文版）並建立支援網路。\\n此外，早日得到診斷還可以有更多的機會參加臨床試驗或研究，嘗試阿茲海默病的可能新治療方法。\\n如需詳情，請前往如何診斷阿茲海默病？（英文版）\\n如何治療阿茲海默病\\n阿茲海默病很複雜，因此不太可能用任何一種藥物或其他干預措施就能成功治療（英文版）罹患此病的所有病人。在持續進行的臨床試驗中，科學家們在開發和測試數種可能的治療干預方法。\\n儘管目前還無法治癒阿茲海默病，但不斷有新的藥物出現，針對根本病因治療疾病的進展。也有一些藥物可以暫時改善或穩定某些病人記憶力和思維能力，可能還有助於控制某些症狀和行為問題。\\n此外，阿茲海默病病人還可能出現失眠（英文版）、抑鬱、焦慮、焦躁不安（英文版）和其他行為及心理症狀。科學家會繼續研究為何出現這些症狀，並且會探索管理這些症狀的新藥物和非藥物措施。研究顯示，治療這些症狀可能會讓阿茲海默病病人感覺更舒適，還可以幫助他們的看護者。抗抑鬱藥、抗精神病藥物和抗焦慮藥物可能對某些阿茲海默病病人有幫助，但專家們都一致認為，只應該在嘗試了其他促進身心舒適感的措施（例如避免緊張情況）之後，方可使用這些藥物。務必要與醫生商談（英文版）哪些治療對您的情況最有效。\\n如需詳情，請前往如何治療阿茲海默病？（英文版）\\n有關阿茲海默病治療的臨床試驗\\n測試阿茲海默病治療方法的臨床試驗需要志願者的參加。透過參加其中一項研究，您可以幫助科學家們發現阿茲海默病新的治療方法，並提供有用的資訊，從而幫助阿茲海默病病人。\\n查找您附近的臨床試驗（英文版）\\n為家人和阿茲海默病看護者提供的支援\\n護理阿茲海默病病人可消耗大量的體力、情感和金錢。日復一日的護理、家庭角色的改變以及是否將病人送去護理機構的決定都絕非易事。NIA支援對計畫、策略、方法和其他研究的評估工作，以改善阿茲海默病病人及其看護者的護理以及生活品質。\\n充分了解這一疾病是一個重要的長期策略。一些向家人教授阿茲海默病的不同階段以及如何應對棘手行為和其他護理挑戰的計畫會有幫助。\\n良好的應對技能、強大的支援網路以及喘息護理也可以幫助看護者應對照顧患有阿茲海默病的親人所帶來的壓力。例如，堅持運動身體可帶來身體和情感上的益處。\\n一些看護者發現參加互助小組非常重要。這些互助小組讓看護者可以找到喘息服務、表達擔憂、分享經驗、獲得建議並得到情感上的慰藉。許多組織都主辦面對面和線上的互助小組，包括針對早期阿茲海默病病人及其家人的互助小組。\\n如需詳情，請參閱阿茲海默病的護理（英文版）。\\nThis

ε4会增加一个人的阿兹海默病患病风险，而且还与某些群体在更年轻的时候患上阿兹海默病有关。APOE ε2可能会对阿兹海默病提供一定程度的保护。\\n不同基因发生的变化，以及其他生物医学、生活方式和环境因素，都会对可能患上阿兹海默病产生影响。尽管如此，从来都无法有把握地判定一个人是否会患上阿兹海默病\\n如需更多了解阿兹海默病的基因研究，请参阅NIA的阿兹海默病遗传学简明资料。\\n健康、环境和生活方式因素\\n研究显示，有多种遗传学之外的因素可能会影响阿兹海默病的发展和病程。比如说，研究人员非常想知道认知能力下降与血管病症（例如心脏病、中风和高血压），以及代谢疾病（例如糖尿病和肥胖症）之间的关系。持续进行的研究会帮助我们了解，降低这些病症的风险因素是否以及如何降低阿兹海默病的患病风险。\\n营养饮食、身体运动、社会交往和锻炼脑力的活动都可以帮助人们在衰老过程中保持健康。这些因素还可能有助于降低出现认知能力下降和阿兹海默病的风险。研究人员目前正在临床试验中测试其中的一些可能性。\\n如何诊断阿兹海默病？\\n医生使用数种方法和工具来帮助判断出现记忆问题的人是否有阿兹海默病。\\n要诊断阿兹海默病，医生可能会：\\n向病人及家人或朋友询问总体健康状况、处方药和非处方药的使用情况、饮食、过往的病症、执行日常活动的能力以及行为和性格的变化。\\n测试记忆力、解决问题的能力、注意力、计数和语言。\\n要求验血、验尿和其他标准医学检测，以帮助发现问题的其他可能原因。\\n进行测试以判断是否是抑郁或其他心理健康病症导致或助长了症状。\\n通过脊椎穿刺采集脑脊液或者要求验血，以测量与阿兹海默病和相关失智症有关联的蛋白质含量。\\n进行脑部扫描，例如CT、MRI或PET（正电子发射断层扫描），以支持阿兹海默病的诊断或排除症状的其他可能原因。\\n可能会重复进行这些检测，以便为医生提供信息，了解病人的记忆力和其他认知功能是如何随时间而变化的。\\n有记忆力和思维问题的人应该询问自己的医生，查明造成这些症状的是阿兹海默病还是其他原因，例如中风、肿瘤、帕金森氏症、睡眠障碍、药物副作用、感染或其他类型的失智症。其中一些病症是可以治疗的，而且有可能逆转。\\n如果确诊为阿兹海默病，在疾病过程中尽快开始治疗可以帮助病人在一段时间保持日常生活的能力。早日得到诊断也可以帮助家人规划未来。他们可以处理财务和法律事务、解决潜在的安全问题、了解居住安排并建立支持网络。\\n此外，早日得到诊断还可以有更多的机会参加临床试验或研究，尝试阿兹海默病的可能的新治疗方法。\\n如需详情，请前往如何诊断阿兹海默病？\\n如何治疗阿兹海默病？\\n阿兹海默病很复杂，因此不太可能用任何一种药物或其他干预措施就能成功治疗罹患此病的所有病人。在持续临床试验中，科学家在开发和测试数种可能的治疗干预方法。\\n尽管目前还无法治愈阿兹海默病，但不断有新的药物出现，针对根本病因治疗疾病的进展。也有一些药物可以暂时改善或稳定某些病人的记忆力和思维能力，可能还有助于控制某些症状和行为问题。\\n此外，阿兹海默病病人还可能出现失眠、抑郁、焦虑、焦躁不安和其他行为及心理症状。科学家会继续研究为何出现这些症状，并且会探索管理这些症状的新药物和非药物策略。研究显示，治疗这些症状可能会让阿兹海默病病人感觉舒适些，还可以帮助他们的看护者。抗抑郁药、抗精神病药物和抗焦虑药物可能对某些阿兹海默病病人有帮助，但专家们都一致认为，只应该在尝试了其他促进身心舒适感的策略（例如避免紧张情况）之后，方可使用这些药物。务必要与医生商谈哪些治疗对您的情况最有效。\\n如需详情，请前往如何治疗阿兹海默病？\\n有关阿兹海默病治疗的临床试验\\n测试阿兹海默病治疗方法的临床试验需要志愿者的参加。通过参加其中一项研究，您可以帮助科学家发现阿兹海默病新的治疗方法，并提供有用的信息，从而帮助阿兹海默病病人。\\n查找您附近的临床试验\\n为家人和阿兹海默病看护者提供的支持\\n护理阿兹海默病病人可消耗大量的体力、情感和金钱。日复一日的护理、家庭角色的改变以及是否将病人送去护理机构的决定都绝非易事。NIA支持对计划、策略、方法和其他研究的评估工作，以改善阿兹海默病病人及其看护者的护理以及生活品质。\\n充分了解这一疾病是一个重要的长期策略。一些向家属教授阿兹海默病的不同阶段以及如何应对棘手行为和其他护理挑战的计划会有帮助。\\n良好的应对技能、强大的支持网络以及喘息护理也可以帮助看护者应对照顾患有阿兹海默病的亲人所带来的压力。例如，坚持运动可带来身体和情感上的益处。\\n一些看护者发现参加互助小组非常重要。这些互助小组让看护者可以找到喘息服务、表达担忧、分享经验、获得建议并得到情感上的慰藉。许多组织都发起了线下和线上的互助小组，包括针对早期阿兹海默病病人及其家人的互助小组。\\nThis

For example, a person with Alzheimer's may see children playing in the living room when no children exist.\\nDelusions are false beliefs that the person thinks are real. For example, the person may think his or her spouse is in love with someone else.\\nParanoia is a type of delusion in which a person may believe—without a good reason—that others are mean, lying, unfair, or “out to get me.” He or she may become suspicious, fearful, or jealous of people.\\nIf a person with Alzheimer’s has ongoing disturbing hallucinations or delusions, seek medical help. An illness or medication may cause these behaviors. Medicines are available to treat these behaviors but must be used with caution. The following tips may also help you cope with these behaviors.\\nHallucinations and delusions\\nHere are some tips for coping with hallucinations and delusions:\\nDiscuss with the doctor any illnesses the person with Alzheimer’s has and medicines he or she is taking. Sometimes an illness or medicine may cause hallucinations or delusions.\\nTry not to argue with the person about what he or she sees or hears. Comfort the person if he or she is afraid.\\nDistract the person. Sometimes moving to another room or going outside for a walk helps.\\nTurn off the TV when violent or upsetting programs are on. Someone with Alzheimer’s may think these events are happening in the room.\\nMake sure the person is safe and can’t reach anything that could be used to hurt anyone or himself or herself.\\nParanoia\\nIn a person with Alzheimer’s disease, paranoia often is linked to memory loss. It can become worse as memory loss gets worse. For example, the person may become paranoid if he or she forgets:\\nWhere he or she put something. The person may believe that someone is taking his or her things.\\nThat you are the person’s caregiver. Someone with Alzheimer’s might not trust you if he or she thinks you are a stranger.\\nPeople to whom the person has been introduced. He or she may believe that strangers will be harmful.\\nDirections you just gave. The person may think you are trying to trick him or her.\\nParanoia may be the person’s way of expressing loss. The person may blame or accuse others because no other explanation seems to make sense.\\nRead and share this infographic about how to communicate with a person who has Alzheimer's disease.\\nHere are some tips for coping with paranoia:\\nTry not to react if the person blames you for something.\\nDon’t argue with the person.\\nLet the person know that he or she is safe.\\nUse gentle touching or hugging to show you care.\\nExplain to others that the person is acting this way because he or she has Alzheimer’s disease.\\nSearch for things to distract the person, then talk about what you found. For example, talk about a photograph or keepsake.\\nAlso, keep in mind that someone with Alzheimer’s disease may have a good reason for acting a certain way. He or she may not be paranoid. There are people who take advantage of weak and elderly people. Find out if someone is trying to abuse or steal from the person with Alzheimer’s.

In most people with Alzheimer’s, symptoms first appear later in life. Estimates vary, but experts suggest that more than 6 million Americans, most of them age 65 or older, may have Alzheimer’s.\\nAlzheimer’s is currently ranked as the seventh leading cause of death in the United States and is the most common cause of dementia among older adults.\\nDementia is the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — and behavioral abilities to such an extent that it interferes with a person’s daily life and activities. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person’s functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for help with basic activities of daily living.\\nShare this infographic and help spread the word about understanding different types of dementia.\\nThe causes of dementia can vary depending on the types of brain changes that may be taking place. Other forms of dementia include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, and vascular dementia. It is common for people to have mixed dementia — a combination of two or more types of dementia. For example, some people have both Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia.\\nAlzheimer’s disease is named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer. In 1906, Dr. Alzheimer noticed changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness. Her symptoms included memory loss, language problems, and unpredictable behavior. After she died, he examined her brain and found many abnormal clumps (now called amyloid plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers (now called neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles).\\nThese plaques and tangles in the brain are still considered some of the main features of Alzheimer’s. Another feature is the loss of connections between neurons in the brain. Neurons transmit messages between different parts of the brain, and from the brain to muscles and organs in the body.\\nParticipating in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials\\nEverybody — those with Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment as well as healthy volunteers with or without a family history of Alzheimer’s — may be able to take part in clinical trials and studies. Participants in Alzheimer’s clinical research can help scientists learn how the brain changes in healthy aging and in Alzheimer’s.\\nMany volunteers are needed to participate in the hundreds of active clinical trials and studies that are testing ways to better understand, diagnose, treat, and prevent Alzheimer’s. Researchers need participants of different ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities to ensure that results are meaningful for many people. To learn more about clinical trials, watch this video from the NIH National Library of Medicine.\\nNIA leads the federal government’s research efforts on Alzheimer’s. NIA-funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers throughout the United States conduct a wide range of research, including trials and studies of the causes, diagnosis, and management of the disease. NIA also sponsors the Alzheimer’s Clinical Trials Consortium, which is designed to accelerate and expand research and therapies in Alzheimer’s and related dementias.\\nTo learn more about Alzheimer’s clinical trials and studies:\\nTalk to your health care provider about local studies that may be right for you.\\nSearch the Alzheimers.gov Clinical Trials Finder for options near you or sign up for email alerts about new trials and studies.\\nSign up for a registry or matching service to be invited to participate in trials and studies.\\nContact an Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center or a memory or neurology clinic in your community.\\nLearn more about participating in clinical trials. Watch videos of participants in Alzheimer’s clinical trials talking about their experiences.\\nHow does Alzheimer's disease affect the brain?\\nScientists continue to unravel the complex brain changes involved in Alzheimer’s. Changes in the brain may begin a decade or more before symptoms appear. During this very early stage of Alzheimer’s, toxic changes are taking place in the brain, including abnormal buildups of proteins that form amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Previously healthy neurons stop functioning, lose connections with other neurons, and die. Many other complex brain changes are thought to play a role in Alzheimer’s as well.\\nThe damage initially appears to take place in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, which are parts of the brain that are essential in forming memories. As more neurons die, additional parts of the brain are affected and begin to shrink. By the final stage of Alzheimer’s, damage is widespread and brain tissue has shrunk significantly.\\nSigns and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease\\nMemory problems are typically one of the first signs of cognitive impairment related to Alzheimer’s. Some people with memory problems have a condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). With MCI, people have more memory problems than normal for their age, but their symptoms do not interfere with their everyday lives. Movement difficulties and problems with the sense of smell have also been linked to MCI. Older people with MCI are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer’s, but not all of them do so. Some may even revert to normal cognition.\\nThe first symptoms of Alzheimer’s vary from person to person. For many, decline in nonmemory aspects of cognition, such as word finding, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning or judgment may signal the very early stages of the disease. Researchers are studying biomarkers (biological signs of disease found in brain images, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood) to detect early changes in the brains of people with MCI and in cognitively normal people who may be at greater risk for Alzheimer’s. More research is needed before these techniques can be used broadly and routinely to diagnose Alzheimer’s in a health care provider’s office.\\nStages of Alzheimer's disease\\nMild Alzheimer’s disease\\nAs Alzheimer’s worsens, people experience greater memory loss and other cognitive difficulties. Problems can include wandering and getting lost, trouble handling money and paying bills, repeating questions, taking longer to complete normal daily tasks, and personality and behavior changes. People are often diagnosed in this stage.\\nModerate Alzheimer’s disease\\nIn this stage, damage occurs in areas of the brain that control language, reasoning, conscious thought, and sensory processing, such as the ability to correctly detect sounds and smells. Memory loss and confusion grow worse, and people begin to have problems recognizing family and friends. They may be unable to learn new things, carry out multistep tasks such as getting dressed, or cope with new situations. In addition, people at this stage may have hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia and may behave impulsively.\\nSevere Alzheimer’s disease\\nUltimately, plaques and tangles spread throughout the brain, and brain tissue shrinks significantly. People with severe Alzheimer’s cannot communicate and are completely dependent on others for their care. Near the end of life, the person may be in bed most or all of the time as the body shuts down.\\nWhat causes Alzheimer’s disease?\\nIn recent years, scientists have made tremendous progress in better understanding Alzheimer’s and the momentum continues to grow. Still, scientists don’t yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer’s disease in most people. The causes probably include a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. The importance of any one of these factors in increasing or decreasing the risk of developing Alzheimer’s may differ from person to person.\\nThe basics of Alzheimer’s disease\\nScientists are conducting studies to learn more about plaques, tangles, and other biological features of Alzheimer’s. Advances in brain imaging techniques enable researchers to see the development and spread of abnormal amyloid and tau proteins in the living brain, as well as changes in brain structure and function. Scientists are also exploring the very earliest steps in the disease process by studying changes in the brain and body fluids that can be detected years before Alzheimer’s symptoms appear. Findings from these studies will help improve our understanding of the causes of Alzheimer’s and make diagnosis easier.\\nOne of the great mysteries of Alzheimer’s is why it largely affects older adults. Research on normal brain aging is exploring this question. For example, scientists are learning how age-related changes in the brain may harm neurons and affect other types of brain cells to contribute to Alzheimer’s damage. These age-related changes include atrophy (shrinking) of certain parts of the brain, inflammation, blood vessel damage, production of unstable molecules called free radicals, and mitochondrial dysfunction (a breakdown of energy production within a cell).\\nAlzheimer's disease genetics\\nIn most cases, Alzheimer’s does not have a single genetic cause. Instead, it is likely influenced by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. Changes in genes, called genetic variations, may increase or decrease a person’s risk of developing the disease.\\nScientists currently know of more than 80 genetic regions associated with Alzheimer’s. Of the genetic variants associated with Alzheimer’s so far, only three are known to cause the disease. Although it happens rarely, when someone inherits an altered version of one of these genes — APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 — they will likely develop Alzheimer’s before age 65 and sometimes much earlier.\\nPeople with Down syndrome also have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s earlier in life. Down syndrome results from having an extra chromosome 21, which carries the APP gene that produces the amyloid precursor protein. Too much of this protein leads to build-up of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Estimates suggest that 50% or more of people living with Down syndrome will develop Alzheimer’s with symptoms appearing in their 50s and 60s.\\nAnother genetic variation, in the APOE gene, which has several forms, is known to influence the risk of Alzheimer’s. Specifically, APOE ε4 increases a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s and is also associated with developing Alzheimer’s earlier in life for certain populations. APOE ε2 may provide some protection against Alzheimer’s.\\nChanges in different genes, along with other biomedical, lifestyle, and environmental factors, play a role in potentially developing Alzheimer’s. Still, it is never known for certain if any individual will or will not develop the disease.\\nFor more about Alzheimer’s genetics research, see NIA’s Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Fact Sheet.\\nHealth, environmental, and lifestyle factors\\nResearch suggests that a host of factors beyond genetics may play a role in the development and course of Alzheimer’s. There is a great deal of interest, for example, in the relationship between cognitive decline and vascular conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure, as well as metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. Ongoing research will help us understand whether and how reducing risk factors for these conditions may also reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s.\\nA nutritious diet, physical activity, social engagement, and mentally stimulating pursuits have all been associated with helping people stay healthy as they age. These factors might also help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s. Researchers are testing some of these possibilities in clinical trials.\\nHow is Alzheimer’s disease diagnosed?\\nDoctors use several methods and tools to help determine whether a person who is having memory problems has Alzheimer’s.\\nTo diagnose Alzheimer’s, doctors may:\\nAsk the person and a family member or friend questions about overall health, use of prescription and over-the-counter medicines, diet, past medical problems, ability to carry out daily activities, and changes in behavior and personality.\\nConduct tests of memory, problem solving, attention, counting, and language.\\nOrder blood, urine, and other standard medical tests to help identify other possible causes of the problem.\\nAdminister tests to determine if depression or another mental health condition is causing or contributing to a person’s symptoms.\\nCollect cerebrospinal fluid via a spinal tap or order blood tests to measure the levels of proteins associated with Alzheimer’s and related dementias.\\nPerform brain scans, such as CT, MRI, or PET (positron emission tomography), to support an Alzheimer’s diagnosis or to rule out other possible causes for symptoms.\\nThese tests may be repeated to give doctors information about how the person’s memory and other cognitive functions are changing over time.\\nPeople with memory and thinking concerns should talk to their doctor to find out whether their symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s or to another cause, such as stroke, tumor, Parkinson’s disease, sleep disturbances, side effects of medication, an infection, or another type of dementia. Some of these conditions may be treatable and, possibly, reversible.\\nIf the diagnosis is Alzheimer’s, beginning treatment as early as possible in the disease process may help preserve daily functioning for a while. An early diagnosis also helps families plan for the future. They can take care of financial and legal matters, address potential safety issues, learn about living arrangements, and develop support networks.\\nIn addition, an early diagnosis provides people with more opportunities to participate in clinical trials or studies testing possible new treatments for Alzheimer’s.\\nFor more information, visit How Is Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosed?\\nHow is Alzheimer’s disease treated?\\nAlzheimer’s is complex, and it is therefore unlikely that any one drug or other intervention will successfully treat it in all people living with the disease. In ongoing clinical trials, scientists are developing and testing several possible treatment interventions.\\nWhile there is currently no cure for Alzheimer’s, medications are emerging to treat the progression of the disease by targeting its underlying causes. There are also medications that may temporarily improve or stabilize memory and thinking skills in some people and may help manage certain symptoms and behavioral problems.\\nAdditionally, people with Alzheimer’s also may experience sleeplessness, depression, anxiety, agitation, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms. Scientists continue to research why these symptoms occur and are exploring new medications and non-drug strategies to manage them. Research shows that treating these symptoms may make people with Alzheimer’s feel more comfortable and also help their caregivers. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anti-anxiety drugs may be helpful for some people with Alzheimer’s, but experts agree that these medicines should be used only after other strategies to promote physical and emotional comfort, such as avoiding stressful situations, have been tried. It’s important to talk with a doctor about what treatment will be most effective in your situation.\\nFor more information, visit How Is Alzheimer's Disease Treated?\\nClinical trials on Alzheimer’s disease treatments\\nVolunteers are needed for clinical trials that are testing ways to treat Alzheimer’s. By joining one of these studies, you may help scientists discover new Alzheimer’s treatments and contribute useful information to help people living with Alzheimer's disease.\\nFind clinical trials near you\\nSupport for families and Alzheimer's disease caregivers\\nCaring for a person with Alzheimer’s can have significant physical, emotional, and financial costs. The demands of day-to-day care, changes in family roles, and decisions about placement in a care facility can be difficult. NIA supports efforts to evaluate programs, strategies, approaches, and other research to improve the quality of care and life for those living with dementia and their caregivers.\\nBecoming well-informed about the disease is one important long-term strategy. Programs that teach families about the various stages of Alzheimer’s and about ways to deal with difficult behaviors and other caregiving challenges can help.\\nGood coping skills, a strong support network, and respite care are other things that may help caregivers handle the stress of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s. For example, staying physically active provides physical and emotional benefits.\\nSome caregivers have found that joining a support group is a critical lifeline. These support groups enable caregivers to find respite, express concerns, share experiences, get tips, and receive emotional comfort. Many organizations sponsor in-person and online support groups, including groups for people with early-stage Alzheimer’s and their families.\\nFor more information, see Alzheimer’s Caregiving.\\nSign up for email updates\\nReceive weekly tips and resources on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias from NIA's Alzheimers.gov\\n*Email Address\\nFor more information about Alzheimer’s disease\\nNIA Alzheimer’s and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center\\n800-438-4380\\nadear@nia.nih.gov(link sends email)\\nwww.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers\\nThe NIA ADEAR Center offers information and free print publications about Alzheimer’s and related dementias for families, caregivers, and health professionals.

Five Questions To Consider\\nOn this page:\\nHow old are you?\\nDoes Alzheimer's run in your family?\\nWhat's your lifestyle?\\nWhat medical conditions do you have?\\nWhat about biomarkers?\\nThe bottom line\\nAsk yourself the five questions below to help understand your risk factors for developing Alzheimer’s disease.\\nHow old are you?\\nAge is the biggest known risk factor for Alzheimer’s. Most people with Alzheimer’s develop the disease when they are 65 or older, with less than 10% of cases occurring before then. As a person ages past 65, their risk of Alzheimer’s increases. About one in 13 people age 65 to 84 and one in three people 85 and older are living with Alzheimer’s.\\nDoes Alzheimer's run in your family?\\nShare this infographic and help spread the word about Alzheimer's genetics.\\nFamily history is also an important risk factor. People with a parent or sibling diagnosed with Alzheimer’s have a higher risk of developing the disease than those who don’t have family members with the disease. Families can have many things in common, including their genes, environment, and lifestyle, that all may play a role. For example, lifestyle habits such as diet and exercise, which can be influenced by family, can affect overall health and increase risk for Alzheimer’s. Importantly, not everyone with a history of Alzheimer’s in their family will develop the disease and vice versa — not everyone who develops Alzheimer’s has a family history of the disease.\\nWhat's your lifestyle?\\nThere are some risk factors, like age, that you cannot change. However, there may be ways to promote better brain health and reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s by addressing certain lifestyle factors, including:\\nUnmanaged chronic health issues, such as high blood pressure or hearing loss\\nPhysical inactivity\\nUnhealthy diet\\nAlcohol misuse\\nSmoking\\nNot getting enough sleep or not sleeping well\\nSocial isolation\\nLack of mental stimulation\\nResearchers cannot yet say for certain whether making positive changes in these areas can prevent dementia, but doing so is beneficial to living a healthier lifestyle overall. Learn more about leading a healthy lifestyle that may help address risk factors associated with Alzheimer’s and related dementias.\\nWhat medical conditions do you have?\\nHaving certain medical conditions may increase your risk of developing Alzheimer’s. For example, cardiovascular disease, which includes conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and coronary artery disease, affects the heart and blood vessels and has been linked to Alzheimer’s.\\nSeveral risk factors associated with developing cardiovascular disease are also associated with Alzheimer’s. For example, studies have shown that managing high blood pressure reduces the risk of mild cognitive impairment and the risk of dementia. Specifically, one large clinical trial showed that lowering systolic blood pressure to below 120 mmHg reduced the risk of mild cognitive impairment, and a review of observational studies showed that managing high blood pressure with medication reduced the risk of dementia compared to people with high blood pressure who didn’t take medication. Learn more about blood pressure and Alzheimer’s and ways to control your blood pressure.\\nOther risk factors associated with both cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s include diabetes, overweight or obesity, and high LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.\\nIn addition, other medical conditions associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s include:\\nHearing loss\\nDepression\\nMild cognitive impairment\\nConcussion or other traumatic brain injury\\nGetting recommended health screenings and regularly checking in with a health care provider can help you learn about and manage medical conditions. Treat high blood pressure with healthy lifestyle changes and medications if prescribed by your doctor. Protect your ears from loud sounds and use hearing restorative devices, such as hearing aids, if needed. Make healthy food choices and get regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.\\nWhat about biomarkers?\\nBiomarkers are characteristics we can measure that help show what’s happening inside the body. Scientists have identified several biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s. While testing for biomarkers can provide some information about a person’s risk, these tests can’t tell for sure whether or not someone will develop the disease. Right now, many of these biomarkers are used mostly in research settings or to help doctors in diagnosing the disease.\\nGenetic variants are a type of biomarker that have been associated with Alzheimer’s risk. Variants in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene are one example. A variant called APOE ε4 has been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s in certain populations, while a variant called APOE ε2 may offer some protection against Alzheimer’s in others.\\nAt-home tests are available for a fee to test for APOE variants. People considering such tests will benefit from talking with a doctor or genetic counselor to better understand the test and what their results may mean. Learn more about Alzheimer’s and genetics.\\nOther biomarkers for Alzheimer’s include levels of the proteins beta-amyloid and tau. Doctors may use brain scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests that measure these protein levels to help determine whether a person’s cognitive difficulties are caused by Alzheimer’s or not. Blood tests are also now available that can measure levels of beta-amyloid. However, none of these tests are commonly used to indicate someone’s risk outside of a research setting.\\nIdentifying who may or may not develop Alzheimer’s is complex. Researchers continue to investigate biomarkers and other risk factors for the disease. Learn more about biomarkers that help diagnose Alzheimer’s or a related dementia.\\nThe bottom line\\nScientists are still learning about what causes Alzheimer’s and what puts some people at higher risk than others. While we know some of the factors that influence a person’s risk, there are probably many other factors that have not yet been identified. Talk with a doctor if you have concerns or questions about your risk of developing the disease. The doctor may suggest changes in memory and thinking to watch out for. They may also recommend steps for staying healthy overall to help maintain cognitive health and reduce the risk of dementia.\\nYou may also be interested in\\nLearning about research advances in Alzheimer's prevention\\nViewing an infographic of healthy lifestyle choices that may reduce your risk of dementia\\nWatching a video on biomarkers and how they can help diagnose dementia(link is external)\\nSignup for e-alerts about Alzheimers.gov highlights\\n*Email Address\\nFor more information about Alzheimer’s risk\\nNIA Alzheimer’s and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center\\n800-438-4380\\nadear@nia.nih.gov(link sends email)\\nwww.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers\\nThe NIA ADEAR Center offers information and free print publications about Alzheimer’s and related dementias for families, caregivers, and health professionals.

Memory problems are typically one of the first signs of the disease. Decline in non-memory aspects of cognition, such as finding the right word, trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships, and impaired reasoning or judgment, may also signal the early stages of Alzheimer’s. As the disease progresses, symptoms become more severe and include increased confusion and behavior changes.\\nFor most people with Alzheimer’s — those who have the late-onset variety — symptoms first appear in their mid-60s or later. When the disease develops before age 65, it’s considered early-onset Alzheimer’s, which can begin as early as a person’s 30s, although this is rare.\\nAlzheimer’s typically progresses clinically in several stages: preclinical, mild (sometimes called early-stage), moderate, and severe (sometimes called late-stage).\\nPreclinical Alzheimer’s disease\\nResearch suggests that the complex brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s, such as the formation of amyloid plaques or tau tangles, start a decade or more before memory and thinking problems appear. This stage, in which changes in the brain appear before the onset of dementia, is called preclinical Alzheimer’s. However, it’s important to note that not everyone with these brain changes develops dementia.\\nSigns of Mild Alzheimer’s disease\\nIn mild Alzheimer’s, a person may seem healthy but has more and more trouble making sense of the world around them. The realization that something is wrong often comes gradually to the person and their family. Problems can include:\\nMemory loss that disrupts daily life\\nPoor judgment, leading to bad decisions\\nLoss of spontaneity and sense of initiative\\nLosing track of dates or knowing current location\\nTaking longer to complete normal daily tasks\\nRepeating questions or forgetting recently learned information\\nTrouble handling money and paying bills\\nChallenges in planning or solving problems\\nWandering and getting lost\\nLosing things or misplacing them in odd places\\nDifficulty completing tasks such as bathing\\nMood and personality changes\\nIncreased anxiety and/or aggression\\nAlzheimer’s is often diagnosed at this stage.\\nSigns of moderate Alzheimer’s disease\\nIn this stage, more intensive supervision and care become necessary. These changes and increasing needs can be difficult for many spouses and families. Symptoms may include:\\nRead and share this infographic to learn about how to tell the difference between age-related forgetfulness and dementia.\\nIncreased confusion and memory loss, such as forgetting events or personal history\\nWithdrawal from social activities\\nInability to learn new things\\nDifficulty with language and problems with reading, writing, and working with numbers\\nDifficulty organizing thoughts and thinking logically\\nShortened attention span\\nProblems coping with new situations\\nChanges in sleeping patterns, such as sleeping more during the day and being restless at night\\nDifficulty carrying out familiar, multistep tasks, such as getting dressed\\nOccasional problems recognizing family and friends\\nHallucinations, delusions, and paranoia\\nImpulsive behavior, such as undressing at inappropriate times or places, or using vulgar language\\nInappropriate emotional outbursts  \\nRestlessness, agitation, anxiety, tearfulness, wandering — especially in the late afternoon or evening\\nRepetitive statements or movement, occasional muscle twitches\\nSigns of severe Alzheimer's disease\\nPeople with severe Alzheimer’s cannot communicate and are completely dependent on others for their care. Near the end of life, the person may be in bed most or all of the time as their body shuts down. Symptoms often include:\\nInability to communicate\\nNo awareness of recent experiences or surroundings\\nWeight loss with little interest in eating\\nSeizures\\nGeneral physical decline, including dental, skin, and foot problems \\nDifficulty swallowing\\nGroaning, moaning, or grunting\\nIncreased sleeping\\nLoss of bowel and bladder control\\nA common cause of death for people with Alzheimer’s is aspiration pneumonia. This type of pneumonia develops when a person cannot swallow properly and takes food or liquids into the lungs instead of air.\\nWhile there is currently no cure for Alzheimer’s, there are medicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that may help treat the disease. There are also changes that can be made to the home environment and daily activities to help a person manage their changes in thinking.\\nSymptoms of mild cognitive impairment\\nSome people have a condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which can be an early sign of Alzheimer’s. However, not everyone with MCI will develop Alzheimer’s. People with MCI can still take care of themselves and perform their normal activities. MCI memory problems may include:\\nLosing things often\\nForgetting to go to events or appointments\\nProblems communicating because of difficulty finding words\\nWhen to visit the doctor for memory loss\\nIf you, a family member, or friend has problems remembering recent events or thinking clearly, talk with a doctor. A doctor may ask questions and conduct various tests and procedures to see what might be causing the symptoms. A doctor may also refer you to a specialist, such as a neurologist, for further assessment. Learn more in How Is Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosed?

Symptoms, Types, and Diagnosis\\nOn this page:\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of dementia?\\nWhat causes dementia?\\nWhat are the different types of dementia?\\nHow is dementia diagnosed?\\nWho can diagnose dementia?\\nDementia is the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — to such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities. Some people with dementia cannot control their emotions, and their personalities may change. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of daily living, such as feeding oneself.\\nDementia affects millions of people and is more common as people grow older (about one-third of all people age 85 or older may have some form of dementia) but it is not a normal part of aging. Many people live into their 90s and beyond without any signs of dementia.\\nThere are several different forms of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, which is the most common.\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of dementia?\\nSigns and symptoms of dementia result when once-healthy neurons (nerve cells) in the brain stop working, lose connections with other brain cells, and die. While everyone loses some neurons as they age, people with dementia experience far greater loss.\\nThe signs and symptoms can vary depending on the type and may include:\\nExperiencing memory loss, poor judgment, and confusion\\nDifficulty speaking, understanding and expressing thoughts, or reading and writing\\nWandering and getting lost in a familiar neighborhood\\nTrouble handling money responsibly and paying bills\\nRepeating questions\\nUsing unusual words to refer to familiar objects\\nTaking longer to complete normal daily tasks\\nLosing interest in normal daily activities or events\\nHallucinating or experiencing delusions or paranoia\\nActing impulsively\\nNot caring about other people’s feelings\\nLosing balance and problems with movement\\nPeople with intellectual and developmental disabilities can also develop dementia as they age, and in these cases, recognizing their symptoms can be particularly difficult. It’s important to consider a person’s current abilities and to monitor for changes over time that could signal dementia.\\nWhat causes dementia?\\nDementia is the result of changes in certain brain regions that cause neurons (nerve cells) and their connections to stop working properly. Researchers have connected changes in the brain to certain forms of dementia and are investigating why these changes happen in some people but not others. For a small number of people, rare genetic variants that cause dementia have been identified.\\nAlthough we don’t yet know for certain what, if anything, can prevent dementia, in general, leading a healthy lifestyle may help reduce risk factors.\\nClinical trials on dementia\\nVolunteers are needed for clinical trials that are exploring how to reduce risk of developing dementia. By joining one of these studies, you may learn more about dementia risk factors and contribute useful information to help yourself and others reduce their risk of dementia.\\nFind clinical trials near you\\nShare this infographic and help spread the word about understanding different types of dementia.\\nWhat are the different types of dementia?\\nVarious neurodegenerative disorders and factors contribute to the development of dementia through a progressive and irreversible loss of neurons and brain functioning. Currently, there is no cure for any type of dementia.\\nTypes of dementia include:\\nAlzheimer’s disease, the most common dementia diagnosis among older adults. It is caused by changes in the brain, including abnormal buildups of proteins known as amyloid plaques and tau tangles.\\nFrontotemporal dementia, a rare form of dementia that tends to occur in people younger than 60. It is associated with abnormal amounts or forms of the proteins tau and TDP-43.\\nLewy body dementia, a form of dementia caused by abnormal deposits of the protein alpha-synuclein, called Lewy bodies.\\nVascular dementia, a form of dementia caused by conditions that damage blood vessels in the brain or interrupt the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain.\\nMixed dementia, a combination of two or more types of dementia. For example, through autopsy studies involving older adults who had dementia, researchers have identified that many people had a combination of brain changes associated with different forms of dementia.\\nScientists are investigating how the underlying disease processes in different forms of dementia start and influence each other. They also continue to explore the variety of disorders and disease processes that contribute to dementia. For example, based on autopsy studies, researchers recently characterized another form of dementia known as LATE. Further knowledge gains in the underlying causes of dementia will help researchers better understand these conditions and develop more personalized prevention, treatment, and care strategies.\\nLearn more about how researchers are using neuropathology to address questions and complexities of dementia diseases in Inside the Brain: The Role of Neuropathology in Alzheimer’s Disease Research.\\nWhat is LATE?\\nResearchers who investigate what’s happening inside the brain after death recently helped characterize a new form of dementia: limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). LATE causes symptoms similar to Alzheimer’s, including problems with thinking, remembering, and reasoning, but has different underlying causes involving abnormal clusters of a protein called TDP-43. This protein is also involved in frontotemporal dementia, but LATE exhibits a different pattern of brain changes and tends to affect people over the age of 80. For example, a team of researchers analyzed the brains of 6,196 people with an average age at death of 88 years and found that almost 40% of them may have had LATE.\\nCurrently, there is no way to diagnose LATE in living people. Researchers are working to further explore the causes of and risk factors for LATE and to identify pathways that could help develop methods for doctors to diagnose LATE.\\nTo learn more about LATE, visit What Is Limbic-Predominant Age-Related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE)?\\nOther conditions that cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms include:\\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus, an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain\\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain disorder\\nHuntington's disease, an inherited, progressive brain disease\\nChronic traumatic encephalopathy, caused by repeated traumatic brain injury\\nHIV-associated dementia, a rare disease that occurs when the HIV virus spreads to the brain\\nHeavy alcohol use over a long period of time\\nHead injury, such as a concussion from a fall or accident\\nEmotional problems, such as stress, anxiety, and depression\\nDelirium, a sudden state of confusion and disorientation\\nIn addition, medical conditions such as tumors, vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, or problems with the thyroid, kidney, or liver can also cause serious memory problems that resemble dementia. Some causes of dementia symptoms can be halted or even reversed with treatment. For example, normal pressure hydrocephalus often resolves with treatment.\\nThe similarity in symptoms of various dementias can make it difficult to get an accurate diagnosis. But a proper diagnosis is important to get appropriate treatment.\\nHow is dementia diagnosed?\\nTo diagnose dementia, doctors first assess whether a person has an underlying, potentially treatable, condition that may relate to cognitive difficulties. A physical exam to measure blood pressure and other vital signs, as well as laboratory tests of blood and other fluids to check levels of various chemicals, hormones, and vitamins, can help uncover or rule out possible causes of symptoms.\\nA review of a person’s medical and family history can provide important clues about risk for dementia. Typical questions might include asking about whether dementia runs in the family, how and when symptoms began, changes in behavior and personality, and if the person is taking certain medications that might cause or worsen symptoms.\\nThe following procedures also may be used to diagnose dementia:\\nCognitive and neurological tests. Used to evaluate thinking and physical functioning, these tests include assessments of memory, problem solving, language skills, and math skills, as well as balance, sensory response, and reflexes.\\nBrain scans. These tests can identify strokes, tumors, and other problems that can cause dementia. Scans also identify changes in the brain's structure and function. The most common scans are:\\nComputed tomography (CT), which uses X-rays to produce images of the brain and other organs\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of body structures, including tissues, organs, bones, and nerves\\nPositron emission tomography (PET), which uses radiation to provide pictures of brain activity — such as energy use — or specific molecules in different brain regions.\\nPsychiatric evaluation. If someone is experiencing behavioral or mood changes, a psychiatric evaluation may be recommended to help determine if depression or another mental health condition is causing or contributing to a person's symptoms.\\nGenetic tests. Some forms of dementia are caused by a person’s genes. In these rare cases, a genetic test ordered by a doctor can help people know if they have the altered genes. It is important to talk with a genetic counselor before and after getting tested, along with family members and the doctor. There are also genetic tests that look for genetic variations that affect someone’s risk of developing dementia, but these tests cannot be used to diagnose dementia.\\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests. CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord, providing protection, insulation, and nutrients. Doctors collect CSF by performing a lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap. Measuring the levels of proteins or other substances in CSF may be used to help diagnose Alzheimer's or other types of dementia.\\nBlood tests. It is now possible for many doctors, dependent on state-specific availability reflecting U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines, to order a blood test to measure levels of beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates abnormally in people with Alzheimer’s. Several other blood tests are in development. At present, blood test results alone should not be used to diagnose dementia, but may be taken into consideration along with other tests. However, the availability of these diagnostic tests is still limited.\\nSome of the tests and procedures used to diagnose dementia may not be covered by health insurance. Check with your insurance provider and talk with your health care team to determine what options may work best for you.\\nEarly detection of symptoms is important as some causes can be successfully treated. However, in many cases, the cause of dementia is unknown and cannot be effectively treated. Still, obtaining an early diagnosis can help with managing the condition and planning ahead. In the early stages of dementia, it may be possible for people to continue with their everyday activities. As the disease progresses, people will need to adopt new strategies to help adjust.\\nPlanning ahead may also include deciding what happens if and when the disease becomes more severe. Sometimes, a person with dementia will volunteer to donate their brain after they have died. Brain donation helps researchers study brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. By studying the brains of people who have died, researchers have already learned a great deal about how types of dementia affect the brain and how we might better treat and prevent them. But much more remains to be understood. When donating as part of a research study or to the NIH NeuroBioBank, there is no cost to the family for the donation and an autopsy report. Learn more about brain donation.\\nWho can diagnose dementia?\\nVisiting a primary care doctor is often the first step for people who are experiencing changes in thinking, movement, or behavior. However, neurologists — doctors who specialize in disorders of the brain and nervous system — are often consulted to diagnose dementia. Geriatric psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and geriatricians may also be able to diagnose dementia. Your primary care doctor can help you find a specialist.\\nIf a specialist cannot be found in your community, contact the nearest medical school neurology department for a referral. A medical school hospital also may have a dementia clinic that provides expert evaluation. You can also visit the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers directory to see if there is an NIA-funded center near you. Researchers at these centers can help with obtaining a diagnosis and medical management of conditions.\\nYou may be interested in\\nLearning ways to live alone with Early-Stage Dementia\\nChecking out this video on dementia(link is external)\\nSharing an infographic about age-related forgetfulness and dementia\\nSign up for email updates\\nReceive weekly tips and resources on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias from NIA's Alzheimers.gov\\n*Email Address\\nFor more information about dementia\\nNIA Alzheimer’s and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center\\n800-438-4380\\nadear@nia.nih.gov(link sends email)\\nwww.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers\\nThe NIA ADEAR Center offers information and free print publications about Alzheimer’s and related dementias for families, caregivers, and health professionals.

Similar to other forms of brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, LATE causes problems with memory and thinking but has different underlying causes.\\nDementia is the result of changes in certain brain regions that cause nerve cells (also known as neurons) and their connections to stop working properly. Researchers have connected changes in the brain to certain forms of dementia. For example, the hallmark brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s are the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles.\\nResearchers identified LATE based on results of autopsy studies that revealed abnormal clusters of a protein called TDP-43. TDP-43 is involved in other brain disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In LATE, it exhibits a different pattern of brain changes and tends to affect people over the age of 80.\\nWhat causes LATE?\\nThe TDP-43 protein normally helps to regulate gene expression in the brain and other tissues. Deposits of this protein have been associated with deterioration of parts of the brain involved in memory, such as the hippocampus, resulting in cognitive impairment.\\nRecent autopsy studies examining tissue from donated brains found that certain patterns of misfolded TDP-43 proteins may be common in older adults. Researchers characterized this pattern of misfolded protein deposits as LATE.\\nFor example, results from autopsy studies of more than 6,000 people with an average age at death of 88 years found that 40% had TDP-43 protein deposits associated with LATE and that LATE was associated with deficits in memory and thinking in approximately 25% of the donors. Those same studies also suggest that LATE can contribute to cognitive decline alone or in combination with other types of dementia. Just over half of those with signs of LATE also had evidence of Alzheimer’s-related proteins, suggesting that having more than one of these brain disorders may contribute to more rapid decline than either disease alone.\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of LATE?\\nThe symptoms of LATE are similar to those of Alzheimer’s. These include:\\nProblems with memory\\nDifficulty thinking and making decisions\\nTrouble finding the right words\\nWandering or getting lost\\nHow is LATE diagnosed?\\nCurrently, there is no way to diagnose LATE in living people. It can only be diagnosed after death through autopsy.\\nIf you are concerned about memory problems or other symptoms of dementia, talk with a doctor. You may be referred to a neurologist, which is a doctor specializing in disorders of the brain and nervous system.\\nWhat’s next for LATE research?\\nResearchers continue to investigate the causes of and risk factors for LATE and ways to diagnose this disease in living people. For example, researchers are currently examining data to explore whether LATE has a unique pattern of brain degeneration and memory loss that could help further distinguish it from Alzheimer’s. They are also exploring whether there are unique molecular signatures for LATE that might be used to create a blood or spinal fluid diagnostic test.\\nResearch into LATE and the underlying causes of dementia would not be possible without volunteers who donate their brains after death. If you’re interested in participating in research that involves brain donation, read Brain Donation: A Gift for Future Generations.\\nAdditional information about participating in research to discover new ways to potentially diagnose, treat, and prevent dementia can be found through NIA-funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers and by visiting the Alzheimers.gov clinical trials finder.\\nYou may also be interested in\\nLearning more about the types, symptoms, and diagnosis of dementia\\nDiscovering more about cognitive health and older adults\\nReading about memory problems, forgetfulness, and aging\\nSign up for e-alerts about Alzheimers.gov highlights\\n*Email Address\\nFor more information about dementia\\nNIA Alzheimer’s and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center\\n800-438-4380\\nadear@nia.nih.gov(link sends email)\\nwww.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers\\nThe NIA ADEAR Center offers information and free print publications about Alzheimer’s and related dementias for families, caregivers, and health professionals.
